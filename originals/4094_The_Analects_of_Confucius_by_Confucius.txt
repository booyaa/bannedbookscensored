【第一章】
【一節】子曰、 學而時習之、不亦說乎。【二節】有朋自遠方來、不亦樂
乎。【三節】人不知而不慍、不亦君子乎。
        CHAPTER I. 1. The Master said, 'Is it not pleasant to learn 
with a constant perseverance and application?
        2. 'Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant 
quarters?'
        3. 'Is he not a man of complete virtue, who feels no 
discomposure though men may take no note of him?'

【第二章】【一節】有子曰、其為人也孝弟、而好犯上者鮮矣、不好犯上、
而好作亂者、未之有也。【二節】君子務本、本立、而道生、孝
        CHAP. II. 1. The philosopher Yu said, 'They are few who, 
being filial and fraternal, are fond of offending against their 
superiors. There have been none, who, not liking to offend 
against their superiors, have been fond of stirring up confusion.
        2. 'The superior man bends his attention to what is 
radical.

弟也者、其為仁之本與。
【第三章】子曰、巧言令色、鮮矣仁。
【第四章】曾子曰、吾日三省吾身、為人謀、而不忠乎、與朋友交、而不信
乎、傳不習乎。
That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up. 
Filial piety and fraternal submission!-- are they not the root of 
all benevolent actions?'
        CHAP. III. The Master said, 'Fine words and an 
insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue.'
        CHAP. IV. The philosopher Tsang said, 'I daily examine 
myself on three points:-- whether, in transacting business for 
others, I may have been not faithful;-- whether, in intercourse 
with friends, I may have been not sincere;-- whether I may 
have not mastered and practised the instructions of my 
teacher.'

【第五章】子曰、道千乘之國、敬事而信、節用而愛人、使民以時。
【第六章】子曰、弟子、入則孝、出則弟、謹而信、凡愛眾、而親仁、行有
餘力、則以學文。

        CHAP. V. The Master said, To rule a country of a thousand 
chariots, there must be reverent attention to business, and 
sincerity; economy in expenditure, and love for men; and the 
employment of the people at the proper seasons.'
        CHAP. VI. The Master said, 'A youth, when at home, 
should be filial, and, abroad, respectful to his elders. He should 
be earnest and truthful. He should overflow in love to all, and 
cultivate the friendship of the good. When he has time and 
opportunity, after the performance of these things, he should 
employ them in polite studies.'
        CHAP. VII. Tsze-hsia said, 'If a man withdraws his mind 
from the love of beauty, and applies it as sincerely to the love 
of the virtuous; if, in serving his parents, he can exert his 
utmost strength;

與朋友交、言而有信、雖曰未學、吾必謂之學矣。
【第八章】【一節】子曰、君子不重、則不威、學則不固。【二節】主忠信。
【三節】無友不如己者。【四節】過則勿憚改。
【第九章】曾子曰、慎終追遠、民德歸厚矣。
if, in serving his prince, he can devote his life; if, in his 
intercourse with his friends, his words are sincere:-- although 
men say that he has not learned, I will certainly say that he 
has.'
        CHAP. VIII. 1. The Master said, 'If the scholar be not 
grave, he will not call forth any veneration, and his learning 
will not be solid.
        2. 'Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles.
        3. 'Have no friends not equal to yourself.
        4. 'When you have faults, do not fear to abandon them.'
        CHAP. IX. The philosopher Tsang said, 'Let there be a 
careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents, and let 
them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of 
sacrifice;-- then the virtue of the people will resume its proper 
excellence.' 

【第十章】【一節】子禽問於子貢曰、夫子至於是邦也、必聞其政、求之與、
抑與之與。【二節】子貢曰、夫子溫､良､恭､儉､讓、以得之、夫子之求
之也、其諸異乎人之求之與。
【十一章】子曰、父在、觀其志、父沒、觀其行、三年無改於父之道、可謂
孝矣。
CHAP. X. 1. Tsze-ch'in asked Tsze-kung, saying, 'When our 
master comes to any country, he does not fail to learn all about 
its government. Does he ask his information? or is it given to 
him?'
        2. Tsze-kung said, 'Our master is benign, upright, 
courteous, temperate, and complaisant, and thus he gets his 
information. The master's mode of asking information!-- is it 
not different from that of other men?'
        CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'While a man's father is alive, 
look at the bent of his will; when his father is dead, look at his 
conduct. If for three years he does not alter from the way of 
his father, he may be called filial.'

【十二章】【一節】有子曰、禮之用、和為貴、先王之道、斯為美；小大由
之。【二節】有所不行、知和而和、不以禮節之、亦不可行也。
【十三章】有子曰、信近於義、言可復也、恭近於禮、遠恥辱也、因不失其
親、亦可宗也。
【十四章】子曰、君子食無求
CHAP. XII. 1. The philosopher Yu said, 'In practising the rules of 
propriety, a natural ease is to be prized. In the ways prescribed 
by the ancient kings, this is the excellent quality, and in things 
small and great we follow them.
        2. 'Yet it is not to be observed in all cases. If one, knowing 
how such ease should be prized, manifests it, without 
regulating it by the rules of propriety, this likewise is not to be 
done.'
        CHAP. XIII. The philosopher Yu said, 'When agreements 
are made according to what is right, what is spoken can be 
made good. When respect is shown according to what is proper, 
one keeps far from shame and disgrace. When the parties upon 
whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with, he 
can make them his guides and masters.'
        CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'He who aims to be a man of 
complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his 
appetite, nor

飽、居無求安、敏於事、而慎於言、就有道、而正焉、可謂好學也已。
【十五章】【一節】子貢曰貧、而無諂、富而無驕、何如。子曰、可也、未
若貧而樂、富而好禮者也。【二節】子貢曰、詩云、如切如磋、如琢如磨、
其斯之謂與。【三節】子曰、賜也、始可與言詩
in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease; he is 
earnest in what he is doing, and careful in his speech; he 
frequents the company of men of principle that he may be 
rectified:-- such a person may be said indeed to love to learn.'
        CHAP. XV. 1. Tsze-kung said, 'What do you pronounce 
concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter, and the rich 
man who is not proud?' The Master replied, 'They will do; but 
they are not equal to him, who, though poor, is yet cheerful, 
and to him, who, though rich, loves the rules of propriety.'
        2. Tsze-kung replied, 'It is said in the Book of Poetry, "As 
you cut and then file, as you carve and then polish."-- The 
meaning is the same, I apprehend, as that which you have just 
expressed.'
        3. The Master said, 'With one like Ts'ze, I can begin to 
talk

已矣、告諸往而知來者。
【十六章】子曰、不患人之不己知、患不知人也。
about the odes. I told him one point, and he knew its proper 
sequence.'
        CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'I will not be afflicted at 
men's not knowing me; I will be afflicted that I do not know 
men.'

star, which keeps its place and all the stars turn towards it.'

【第二章】子曰、詩三百、一言以蔽之、曰、思無邪。
【第三章】【一節】子曰、道之以政、齊之以刑、民免而無恥。【二節】道
之以德、齊之以禮、有恥且格。
【第四章】【一節】子曰、吾十有五而志于學。【二節】三十而立。【三節】
四十而不惑。【四節】五
        CHAP. II. The Master said, 'In the Book of Poetry are 
three hundred pieces, but the design of them all may be 
embraced in one sentence-- "Having no depraved thoughts."'
        CHAP. III. 1. The Master said, 'If the people be led by 
laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, 
they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of 
shame.
        2. 'If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be 
given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense 
of shame, and moreover will become good.'
        CHAP. IV. 1. The Master said, 'At fifteen, I had my mind 
bent on learning.

        6. 'At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, 
without transgressing what was right.'
        CHAP. V. 1. Mang I asked what filial piety was. The 
Master said, 'It is not being disobedient.'
        2. Soon after, as Fan Ch'ih was driving him, the Master 
told him, saying, 'Mang-sun asked me what filial piety was, and 
I answered him,-- "not being disobedient."'
        3. Fan Ch'ih said, 'What did you mean?' The Master 
replied, 'That parents, when alive, be served according to 
propriety; that, when dead, they should be buried according to 
propriety; and that they should be sacrificed to according to 
propriety.'

【第六章】孟武伯問孝、子曰、父母唯其疾之憂。

sick.'
        CHAP. VII. Tsze-yu asked what filial piety was. The 
Master said, 'The filial piety of now-a-days means the support 
of one's parents. But dogs and horses likewise are able to do 
something in the way of support;-- without reverence, what is 
there to distinguish the one support given from the other?'
        CHAP. VIII. Tsze-hsia asked what filial piety was. The 
Master said, 'The difficulty is with the countenance. If, when 
their elders have any troublesome affairs, the young take the 
toil of them, and if, when the young have wine and food, they 
set them before their elders, is THIS to be considered filial 
piety?'

【第九章】子曰、吾與回言終日、不違、如愚。退兒省其私、亦足以發、回
也不愚。
【第十章】【一節】子曰、視其所以。【二節】觀其所由。【三節】察其所
安。【四節】人焉廋哉、人焉廋哉。
【十一章】子曰、溫故而知新、可以為師矣。
        CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'I have talked with Hui for a 
whole day, and he has not made any objection to anything I 
said;-- as if he were stupid. He has retired, and I have 
examined his conduct when away from me, and found him able 
to illustrate my teachings. Hui!-- He is not stupid.'
        CHAP. X. 1. The Master said, 'See what a man does.
        2. 'Mark his motives.
        3. 'Examine in what things he rests.

superior man. The Master said, 'He acts before he speaks, and 
afterwards speaks according to his actions.'
        CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'The superior man is catholic 
and no partisan. The mean man is partisan and not catholic.'
        CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'Learning without thought is 
labour lost; thought without learning is perilous.'

寡尤、多見闕殆、慎行其餘、則寡悔、言寡尤、行寡悔、祿在其中矣。
        CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'Yu, shall I teach you what 
knowledge is? When you know a thing, to hold that you know 
it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not 
know it;-- this is knowledge.'
        CHAP. XVII. 1. Tsze-chang was learning with a view to 
official emolument.
        2. The Master said, 'Hear much and put aside the points 
of which you stand in doubt, while you speak cautiously at the 
same time of the others:-- then you will afford few occasions 
for blame. See much and put aside the things which seem 
perilous, while you are cautious at the same time in carrying 
the others into practice:-- then you will have few occasions for 
repentance. When one gives few occasions for blame in his 
words, and few occasions for repentance in his conduct, he is in 
the way to get emolument.'

done in order to secure the submission of the people?'

crooked, then the people will submit. Advance the crooked and 
set aside the upright, then the people will not submit.'
        CHAP. XX. Chi K'ang asked how to cause the people to 
reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to 
nerve themselves to virtue. The Master said, 'Let him preside 
over them with gravity;-- then they will reverence him. Let 
him be filial and kind to all;-- then they will be faithful to him. 
Let him advance the good and teach the incompetent;-- then 
they will eagerly seek to be virtuous.'
        CHAP. XXI. 1. Some one addressed Confucius, saying, 'Sir, 
why are you not engaged in the government?'

不為政。【二節】子曰、書云孝乎、惟孝友于兄弟、施於有政、是亦為政、
奚其為為政。

之哉。

        2. The Master said, 'What does the Shu-ching say of filial 
piety?-- "You are filial, you discharge your brotherly duties. 
These qualities are displayed in government." This then also 
constitutes the exercise of government. Why must there be 
THAT-- making one be in the government?'
        CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'I do not know how a man 
without truthfulness is to get on. How can a large carriage be 
made to go without the cross-bar for yoking the oxen to, or a 
small carriage without the arrangement for yoking the horses?'
        CHAP. XXIII. 1. Tsze-chang asked whether the affairs of 
ten ages after could be known.
        2. Confucius said, 'The Yin dynasty followed the

of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. 
Some other may follow the Chau, but though it should be at the 
distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known.'

所損益、可知也、周因於殷禮、所損益、可知也、其或繼周者、雖百世、可
知也。

也。
        CHAP. XXIV. 1. The Master said, 'For a man to sacrifice to 
a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery.

vessels were being removed, at the conclusion of the sacrifice.

have in the hall of the three families?'
        CHAP. III. The Master said, 'If a man be without the 
virtues proper to humanity, what has he to do with the rites of 
propriety? If a man be without the virtues proper to humanity, 
what has he to do with music?'
        CHAP. IV. 1. Lin Fang asked what was the first thing to be 
attended to in ceremonies.
        2. The Master said, 'A great question indeed!
        3. 'In festive ceremonies, it is better to be sparing than 
extravagant.

sorrow than a minute attention to observances.'
        CHAP. V. The Master said, 'The rude tribes of the east and 
north have their princes, and are not like the States of our 
great land which are without them.'
        CHAP. VI. The chief of the Chi family was about to 
sacrifice to the T'ai mountain. The Master said to Zan Yu, 'Can

discerning as Lin Fang?'

矣。
        CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'The student of virtue has no 
contentions. If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in 
archery? But he bows complaisantly to his competitors; thus he 
ascends the hall, descends, and exacts the forfeit of drinking. In 
his contention, he is still the Chun-tsze.'
        CHAP. VIII. 1. Tsze-hsia asked, saying, 'What is the 
meaning of the passage-- "The pretty dimples of her artful 
smile! The well-defined black and white of her eye! The plain 
ground for the colours?"'
        2. The Master said, 'The business of laying on the colours 
follows (the preparation of) the plain ground.'
        3. 'Ceremonies then are a subsequent thing?' The Master 
said, 'It is Shang who can bring out my meaning. Now I can 
begin to talk about the odes with him.'

        CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'I could describe the 
ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty, but Chi cannot sufficiently 
attest my words. I could describe the ceremonies of the Yin 
dynasty, but Sung cannot sufficiently attest my words. (They 
cannot do so) because of the insufficiency of their records and 
wise men. If those were sufficient, I could adduce them in 
support of my words.'

pouring out of the libation, I have no wish to look on.'
        CHAP. XI. Some one asked the meaning of the great

on this;-- pointing to his palm.

meaning of the saying, "It is better to pay court to the furnace

Heaven has none to whom he can pray.'

propriety.'
        CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'In archery it is not going

rules of propriety in serving one's prince is accounted by 
people to be flattery.'

prince. Confucius replied, 'A prince should employ his minister 
according to according to the rules of propriety; ministers

one point, and know a second.'

you are not equal to him.'

Master said, 'Rotten wood cannot be carved; a wall of dirty

my reproving him?'
        2. The Master said, 'At first, my way with men was to 
hear their words, and give them credit for their conduct. Now

        CHAP. XVIII. 1. Tsze-chang asked, saying, 'The minister 
Tsze-wan thrice took office, and manifested no joy in his 
countenance. Thrice he retired from office, and manifested no

you say of him?' The Master replied. 'He was loyal.' 'Was he 
perfectly virtuous?' 'I do not know. How can he be pronounced

another State, he said, "They are here like our great officer, 
Ch'ui," and left it. He came to a second State, and with the same

to learn. Confucius replied to him, 'There was Yen Hui; HE loved

man should have such a sickness! That such a man should have 
such a sickness!'
                CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'Admirable indeed was 
the virtue of Hui! With a single bamboo dish of rice, a single 
gourd dish of drink, and living in his mean narrow lane, while

Hui!'

qualities are equally blended, we then have the man of virtue.'
        CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'Man is born for

man extensively conferring benefits on the people, and able to 
assist all, what would you say of him? Might he be called 
perfectly virtuous?' The Master said, 'Why speak only of virtue 
in connexion with him? Must he not have the qualities of a 
sage? Even Yao and Shun were still solicitous about this.
        2. 'Now the man of perfect virtue, wishing to be 
established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to 
be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.
        3. 'To be able to judge of others by what is nigh in 
ourselves;-- this may be called the art of virtue.'

without being wearied:-- which one of these things belongs to 
me?'

proper cultivation; the not thoroughly discussing what is

good:-- these are the things which occasion me solicitude.'

the other three, I do not repeat my lesson.'

        2. Tsze-lu said, 'If you had the conduct of the armies of a 
great State, whom would you have to act with you?'
        3. The Master said, 'I would not have him to act with me, 
who will unarmed attack a tiger, or cross a river without a 
boat, dying without any regret. My associate must be the man 
who proceeds to action full of solicitude, who is fond of 
adjusting his plans, and then carries them into execution.'
        CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'If the search for riches is sure

Master. 'Did they have any repinings because of their course?' 
The Master again replied, 'They sought to act virtuously, and 
they did so; what was there for them to repine about?' On this, 
Tsze-kung went out and said, 'Our Master is not for him.'

reputably) with the people of Hu-hsiang, and a lad of that place 
having had an interview with the Master, the disciples 
doubted.

prince married a daughter of the house of Wu, of the same 
surname with himself, and called her,-- "The elder Tsze of Wu." 
If the prince knew propriety, who does not know it?'

perfect virtue;-- how dare I rank myself with them? It may

said, 'This is just what we, the disciples, cannot imitate you in.'
        CHAP. XXXIV. The Master being very sick, Tsze-lu asked 
leave to pray for him. He said, 'May such a thing be done?'

worlds."' The Master said, 'My praying has been for a long 
time.'

        CHAP. XXXV. The Master said, 'Extravagance leads to

distress.'

straightforwardness, without the rules of propriety, becomes 
rudeness.
        2. 'When those who are in high stations perform well all 
their duties to their relations, the people are aroused to virtue. 
When old friends are not neglected by them, the people are 
preserved from meanness.'
        CHAP. III. The philosopher Tsang being ill, he called to 
him the disciples of his school, and said, 'Uncover my feet, 
uncover my hands. It is said in the Book of Poetry, "We should 
be apprehensive and cautious, as if on the brink of a deep gulf, 
as if treading on thin ice," and so have I been. Now and 
hereafter, I know my escape from all injury to my person, O ye, 
my little children.'

went to ask how he was.
        2. Tsang said to him, 'When a bird is about to die, its 
notes are mournful; when a man is about to die, his words are 
good.
        3. 'There are three principles of conduct which the man of 
high rank should consider specially important:-- that in his 
deportment and manner he keep from violence and 
heedlessness; that in regulating his countenance he keep near 
to sincerity; and that in his words and tones he keep far from 
lowness and impropriety. As to such matters as attending to 
the sacrificial vessels, there are the proper officers for them.'

        CHAP. V. The philosopher Tsang said, 'Gifted with ability, 
and yet putting questions to those who were not so; possessed 
of much, and yet putting questions to those possessed of little; 
having, as though he had not; full, and yet counting himself as 
empty; offended against, and yet entering into no altercation; 
formerly I had a friend who pursued this style of conduct.'
        CHAP. VI. The philosopher Tsang said, 'Suppose that there 
is an individual who can be entrusted with the charge of a 
young orphan prince, and can be commissioned with authority 
over a state of a hundred li, and whom no emergency however 
great can drive from his principles:-- is such a man a superior 
man? He is a superior man indeed.'

        2. 'Perfect virtue is the burden which he considers it is

follow a path of action, but they may not be made to 
understand it.'
        CHAP. X. The Master said, 'The man who is fond of daring

insubordination. So will the man who is not virtuous, when you 
carry your dislike of him to an extreme.'

        CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'Though a man have abilities 
as admirable as those of the Duke of Chau, yet if he be proud 
and niggardly, those other things are really not worth being 
looked at.'

who has learned for three years without coming to be good.'
        CHAP. XIII. 1. The Master said, 'With sincere faith he 
unites the love of learning; holding firm to death, he is 
perfecting the excellence of his course.
        2. 'Such an one will not enter a tottering State, nor dwell 
in a disorganized one. When right principles of government 
prevail in the kingdom, he will show himself; when they are 
prostrated, he will keep concealed.
        3. 'When a country is well-governed, poverty and a mean

accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he 
instituted!'
        CHAP. XX. 1. Shun had five ministers, and the empire was 
well-governed.
        2. King Wu said, 'I have ten able ministers.'
        3. Confucius said, 'Is not the saying that talents are 
difficult to find, true? Only when the dynasties of T'ang and Yu 
met, were they more abundant than in this of Chau, yet there 
was a woman among them. The able ministers were no more 
than nine men.

        4. 'King Wan possessed two of the three parts of the 
empire, and with those he served the dynasty of Yin. The 
virtue of the house of Chau may be said to have reached the 
highest point indeed.'
        CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'I can find no flaw in the 
character of Yu. He used himself coarse food and drink, but 
displayed the utmost filial piety towards the spirits. His 
ordinary garments were poor, but he displayed the utmost 
elegance in his sacrificial cap and apron. He lived in a low mean 
house, but expended all his strength on the ditches and water-
channels. I can find nothing like a flaw in Yu.'

indeed is the philosopher K'ung! His learning is extensive, and 
yet he does not render his name famous by any particular 
thing.'
        2. The Master heard the observation, and said to his 
disciples, 'What shall I practise? Shall I practise charioteering, 
or shall I practise archery? I will practise charioteering.'

prescribed by the rules of ceremony, but now a silk one is 
worn. It is economical, and I follow the common practice.
        2. 'The rules of ceremony prescribe the bowing below the 
hall, but now the practice is to bow only after ascending it. That 
is arrogant. I continue to bow below the hall, though I oppose 
the common practice.'
        CHAP. IV. There were four things from which the Master 
was entirely free. He had no foregone conclusions, no arbitrary 
predeterminations, no obstinacy, and no egoism.

        2. He said, 'After the death of King Wan, was not the

        3. 'If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, 
then I, a future mortal, should not have got such a relation to 
that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, 
what can the people of K'wang do to me?'
        CHAP. VI. 1. A high officer asked Tsze-kung, saying, 'May 
we not say that your Master is a sage? How various is his 
ability!'
        2. Tsze-kung said, 'Certainly Heaven has endowed him 
unlimitedly. He is about a sage. And, moreover, his ability is 
various.'
        3. The Master heard of the conversation and said, 'Does 
the high officer know me? When I was young, my condition 
was low, and therefore I acquired my ability in many things, 
but they were mean matters. Must the superior man have such 
variety of ability? He does not need variety of ability.'
        4. Lao said, 'The Master said, "Having no official 
employment, I acquired many arts."'

        CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'Am I indeed possessed of 
knowledge? I am not knowing. But if a mean person, who 
appears quite empty-like, ask anything of me, I set it forth

        CHAP. VIII. The Master said, 'The FANG bird does not 
come; the river sends forth no map:-- it is all over with me!'

doctrines, sighed and said, 'I looked up to them, and they

they seemed to become more firm; I looked at them before me, 
and suddenly they seemed to be behind.
        2. 'The Master, by orderly method, skilfully leads men on. 
He enlarged my mind with learning, and taught me the 
restraints of propriety.

cannot do so, and having exerted all my ability, there seems 
something to stand right up before me; but though I wish to 
follow and lay hold of it, I really find no way to do so.'
        CHAP. XI. 1. The Master being very ill, Tsze-lu wished the 
disciples to act as ministers to him.
        2. During a remission of his illness, he said, 'Long has the

when I have them not, whom should I impose upon? Should I 
impose upon Heaven?

        3. 'Moreover, than that I should die in the hands of 
ministers, is it not better that I should die in the hands of you, 
my disciples? And though I may not get a great burial, shall I 
die upon the road?'
        CHAP. XII. Tsze-kung said, 'There is a beautiful gem here. 
Should I lay it up in a case and keep it? or should I seek for a 
good price and sell it?' The Master said, 'Sell it! Sell it! But I 
would wait for one to offer the price.'
        CHAP. XIII. 1. The Master was wishing to go and live 
among the nine wild tribes of the east.
        2. Some one said, 'They are rude. How can you do such a 
thing?' The Master said, 'If a superior man dwelt among them, 
what rudeness would there be?'
        CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'I returned from Wei to Lu, 
and then the music was reformed, and the pieces in the Royal

        CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'Abroad, to serve the high 
ministers and nobles; at home, to serve one's father and elder 
brothers; in all duties to the dead, not to dare not to exert one's 
self; and not to be overcome of wine:-- which one of these 
things do I attain to?'

passes on just like this, not ceasing day or night!'
        CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'I have not seen one who 
loves virtue as he loves beauty.'
        CHAP. XVIII. The Master said, 'The prosecution of

work, and I stop, the

stopping is my own work. It may be compared to throwing 
down the earth on the level ground. Though but one basketful 
is thrown at a time, the advancing with it is my own going 
forward.'
        CHAP. XIX. The Master said, 'Never flagging when I set 
forth anything to him;-- ah! that is Hui.'

constant advance. I never saw him stop in his progress.'
        CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'There are cases in which the 
blade springs, but the plant does not go on to flower! There are 
cases where it flowers, but no fruit is subsequently produced!'
        CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'A youth is to be regarded 
with respect. How do we know that his future will not be equal 
to our present? If he reach the age of forty or fifty, and has not 
made himself heard of, then indeed he will not be worth being 
regarded with respect.'

【廿五章】子曰、三軍可奪師也、匹夫不可奪志也。
        CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'Can men refuse to assent to 
the words of strict admonition? But it is reforming the conduct 
because of them which is valuable. Can men refuse to be 
pleased with words of gentle advice? But it is unfolding their 
aim which is valuable. If a man be pleased with these words, 
but does not unfold their aim, and assents to those, but does 
not reform his conduct, I can really do nothing with him.'
        CHAP. XXIV. The Master said, 'Hold faithfulness and

tattered robe quilted with hemp, yet standing by the side of 
men dressed in furs, and not ashamed;-- ah! it is Yu who is 
equal to this!
        2. '"He dislikes none, he covets nothing;-- what can he do 
but what is good!"'
        3. Tsze-lu kept continually repeating these words of the 
ode, when the Master said, 'Those things are by no means 
sufficient to constitute (perfect) excellence.'

cold, then we know how the pine and the cypress are the last

principles, but we shall find them unable to get established in 
those along with us. Or if we may get so established along with 
them, we shall find them unable to weigh occurring events 
along with us.'
        CHAP. XXX. 1. How the flowers of the aspen-plum flutter 
and turn! Do I not think of you? But your house is distant.

        CHAP. I. 1. Confucius, in his village, looked simple and 
sincere, and as if he were not able to speak.
        2. When he was in the prince's ancestorial temple, or in 
the court, he spoke minutely on every point, but cautiously.
        CHAP II. 1. When he was waiting at court, in speaking 
with the great officers of the lower grade, he spake freely, but 
in a straightforward manner; in speaking with those of the 
higher grade, he did so blandly, but precisely.
        2. When the ruler was present, his manner displayed 
respectful uneasiness; it was grave, but self-possessed.

        CHAP. III. 1. When the prince called him to employ him 
in the reception of a visitor, his countenance appeared to 
change, and his legs to move forward with difficulty.
        2. He inclined himself to the other officers among whom 
he stood, moving his left or right arm, as their position 
required, but keeping the skirts of his robe before and behind 
evenly adjusted.
        3. He hastened forward, with his arms like the wings of a 
bird.
        4. When the guest had retired, he would report to the 
prince, 'The visitor is not turning round any more.'
        CHAP. IV. 1. When he entered the palace gate, he seemed 
to bend his body, as if it were not sufficient to admit him.

        2. When he was standing, he did not occupy the middle of 
the gate-way; when he passed in or out, he did not tread upon 
the threshold.
        3. When he was passing the vacant place of the prince, 
his countenance appeared to change, and his legs to bend under 
him, and his words came as if he hardly had breath to utter 
them.
        4. He ascended the reception hall, holding up his robe 
with both his hands, and his body bent; holding in his breath 
also, as if he dared not breathe.
        5. When he came out from the audience, as soon as he 
had descended one step, he began to relax his countenance, and 
had a satisfied look. When he had got to the bottom of the 
steps, he advanced rapidly to his place, with his arms like 
wings, and on occupying it, his manner still showed respectful 
uneasiness.
        CHAP. V. 1. When he was carrying the scepter of his 
ruler, he seemed to bend his body, as if he were not able to 
bear its weight. He did not hold it higher than the position of 
the hands in making

a bow, nor lower than their position in giving anything to 
another. His countenance seemed to change, and look 
apprehensive, and he dragged his feet along as if they were 
held by something to the ground.
        2. In presenting the presents with which he was charged,

footsteps of others, but moreover, he does not enter the 
chamber of the sage.'
        CHAP. XX. The Master said, 'If, because a man's discourse 
appears solid and sincere, we allow him to be a good man, is he 
really a superior man? or is his gravity only in appearance?'
        CHAP. XXI. Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately 
carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, 'There are 
your father and elder brothers to be consulted;-- why should 
you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice 
what you hear?' Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should 
immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master 
answered, 'Immediately carry into practice what you hear.' 
Kung-hsi Hwa said, 'Yu asked whether he should carry 
immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, "There 
are your father and elder brothers to be consulted." Ch'iu asked 
whether he should immediately carry into practice what he 
heard, and you said, "Carry it immediately into practice." I, 
Ch'ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.' 
The Master said, 'Ch'iu is retiring and slow; therefore,

do so, retires.

would not follow him.'
        CHAP. XXIV. 1. Tsze-lu got Tsze-kao appointed governor 
of Pi.
        2. The Master said, 'You are injuring a man's son.'
        3. Tsze-lu said, 'There are (there) common people and 
officers; there are the altars of the spirits of the land and grain. 
Why must one read books before he can be considered to have 
learned?'

glib-tongued people.'

        3. 'From day to day you are saying, "We are not known." 
If some ruler were to know you, what would you like to do?'
        4. Tsze-lu hastily and lightly replied, 'Suppose the case of 
a State of ten thousand chariots; let it be straitened between 
other large States; let it be suffering from invading armies; and 
to this let there be added a famine in corn and in all 
vegetables:-- if I were intrusted with the government of it, in 
three years' time I could make the people to be bold, and to 
recognise the rules of righteous conduct.' The Master smiled at 
him.
        5. Turning to Yen Yu, he said, 'Ch'iu, what are your 
wishes?' Ch'iu replied, 'Suppose a state of sixty or seventy li 
square, or one of fifty or sixty, and let me have the government 
of it;-- in three years' time, I could make plenty to abound 
among the people. As to teaching them the principles of 
propriety, and music, I must wait for the rise of a superior man 
to do that.'

曰、吾與
        6. 'What are your wishes, Ch'ih,' said the Master next to 
Kung-hsi Hwa. Ch'ih replied, 'I do not say that my ability 
extends to these things, but I should wish to learn them. At the 
services of the ancestral temple, and at the audiences of the 
princes with the sovereign, I should like, dressed in the dark 
square-made robe and the black linen cap, to act as a small 
assistant.'
        7. Last of all, the Master asked Tsang Hsi, 'Tien, what are 
your wishes?' Tien, pausing as he was playing on his lute, while 
it was yet twanging, laid the instrument aside, and rose. 'My 
wishes,' he said, 'are different from the cherished purposes of 
these three gentlemen.' 'What harm is there in that?' said the 
Master; 'do you also, as well as they, speak out your wishes.' 
Tien then said, 'In this, the last month of spring, with the dress 
of the season all complete, along with five or six young men 
who have assumed the cap, and six or seven boys, I would 
wash in the I, enjoy the breeze among the rain altars, and 
return home singing.' The Master heaved a sigh and said, 'I 
give my approval to Tien.'

        8. The three others having gone out, Tsang Hsi remained 
behind, and said, 'What do you think of the words of these 
three friends?' The Master replied, 'They simply told each one 
his wishes.'
        9. Hsi pursued, 'Master, why did you smile at Yu?'
        10. He was answered, 'The management of a State 
demands the rules of propriety. His words were not humble; 
therefore I smiled at him.'
        11. Hsi again said, 'But was it not a State which Ch'iu 
proposed for himself?' The reply was, 'Yes; did you ever see a 
territory of sixty or seventy li or one of fifty or sixty, which 
was not a State?'
        12. Once more, Hsi inquired, 'And was it not a State which 
Ch'ih proposed for himself?' The Master again replied, 'Yes; who 
but princes have to do with ancestral temples, and with 
audiences but the sovereign? If Ch'ih were to be a small 
assistant in these services, who could be a great one?

顏淵第十二
BOOK XII. YEN YUAN.

【第一章】【一節】顏淵問仁。子曰、克己復禮為仁、一日克己復禮、天下
歸仁焉、為仁由己、而由人乎哉。【二節】顏淵曰、請問其目。子曰、非禮
勿視、非禮勿聽、非禮勿言、非禮勿動。顏淵曰、回雖不敏、請事斯語矣。
        CHAP. I. 1. Yen Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The 
Master said, 'To subdue one's self and return to propriety, is 
perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and 
return to propriety, all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue 
to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or 
is it from others?'
        2. Yen Yuan said, 'I beg to ask the steps of that process.' 
The Master replied, 'Look not at what is contrary to propriety; 
listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is 
contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to 
propriety.' Yen Yuan then said, 'Though I am deficient in 
intelligence and vigour, I will make it my business to practise 
this lesson.'

【第二章】仲弓問仁。子曰、出門如見大賓、使民如承大祭、己所不欲、勿
施於人、在邦無怨、在家無怨。仲弓曰、雍雖不敏、請事斯語矣。
【第三章】【一節】司馬牛問仁。【二節】子曰、仁者其言
        CHAP. II. Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The 
Master said, 'It is, when you go abroad, to behave to every one 
as if you were receiving a great guest; to employ the people as 
if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to do to others as 
you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuring 
against you in the country, and none in the family.' Chung-kung 
said, 'Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigour, I will 
make it my business to practise this lesson.'
        CHAP. III. 1. Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue.
        2. The Master said, 'The man of perfect virtue is cautious 
and slow in his speech.'

也訒。【三節】曰、其言也訒、斯謂之仁矣乎。子曰、為之難、言之得無訒
乎。
【第四章】【一節】司馬牛問君子。子曰、君子不憂不懼。【二節】曰、不
憂不懼、斯謂之君子矣乎。【三節】子曰、內省不疚、夫何憂何懼。
【第五章】【一節】司馬牛憂曰、人皆有兄弟、我獨亡。【二節】子夏
        3. 'Cautious and slow in his speech!' said Niu;-- 'is this 
what is meant by perfect virtue?' The Master said, 'When a 
man feels the difficulty of doing, can he be other than cautious 
and slow in speaking?'
        CHAP. IV. 1. Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. 
The Master said, 'The superior man has neither anxiety nor 
fear.'
        2. 'Being without anxiety or fear!' said Nui;-- 'does this 
constitute what we call the superior man?'
        3. The Master said, 'When internal examination discovers 
nothing wrong, what is there to be anxious about, what is there 
to fear?'
        CHAP. V. 1. Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, 'Other men 
all have their brothers, I only have not.'
        2. Tsze-hsia said to him, 'There is the following saying 
which I have heard:--

曰、商聞之矣。【三節】死生有命、富貴在天。【四節】君子敬而無失、與
人恭而有禮、四海之內、皆兄弟也、君子何患乎無兄弟也。
【第六章】子張問明。子曰、浸潤之譖、膚受之愬、不行焉、可謂明也已矣、
浸潤之譖、膚受之愬、不行焉、可謂遠也已矣。
        3. '"Death and life have their determined appointment; 
riches and honours depend upon Heaven."
        4. 'Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order 
his own conduct, and let him be respectful to others and 
observant of propriety:-- then all within the four seas will be 
his brothers. What has the superior man to do with being 
distressed because he has no brothers?'
        CHAP. VI. Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. 
The Master said, 'He with whom neither slander that gradually 
soaks into the mind, nor statements that startle like a wound in 
the flesh, are successful, may be called intelligent indeed. Yea, 
he with whom neither soaking slander, nor startling 
statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.'

【第七章】【一節】子貢問政。子曰足食、足兵、民信之矣。【二節】子貢
曰、必不得已而去、於斯三者何先。曰、去兵。子貢曰、必不得已而去、於
斯二者何先。曰、去食、自古皆有死、民無信不立。
【第八章】【一節】棘子成曰、君子質而已矣、何以文為。【二節】子
        CHAP. VII. 1. Tsze-kung asked about government. The 
Master said, 'The requisites of government are that there be 
sufficiency of food, sufficiency of military equipment, and the 
confidence of the people in their ruler.'
        2. Tsze-kung said, 'If it cannot be helped, and one of 
these must be dispensed with, which of the three should be 
foregone first?' 'The military equipment,' said the Master.
        3. Tsze-kung again asked, 'If it cannot be helped, and one 
of the remaining two must be dispensed with, which of them 
should be foregone?' The Master answered, 'Part with the food. 
From of old, death has been the lot of all men; but if the people 
have no faith in their rulers, there is no standing for the state.'
        CHAP. VIII. 1. Chi Tsze-ch'ang said, 'In a superior man it 
is only the substantial qualities which are wanted;-- why 
should we seek for ornamental accomplishments?'

貢曰、惜乎夫子之說、君子也、駟不及舌。【三節】文猶質也、質猶文也、

【第九章】【一節】哀公問於有若曰年饑、用不足、如之何。【二節】有若
對曰、盍徹乎。【三節】曰、二、吾猶不足、如之何其徹也。【四節】對曰、
百姓足、君孰與不足、百姓不足、君孰與足。
        2. Tsze-kung said, 'Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a 
superior man, but four horses cannot overtake the tongue.
        3. Ornament is as substance; substance is as ornament. 
The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, is like the 
hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.'
        CHAP. IX. 1. The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, 'The 
year is one of scarcity, and the returns for expenditure are not 
sufficient;-- what is to be done?'
        2. Yu Zo replied to him, 'Why not simply tithe the 
people?'
        3. 'With two tenths, said the duke, 'I find it not enough;-- 
how could I do with that system of one tenth?'
        4. Yu Zo answered, 'If the people have plenty, their prince 
will not be left to want alone. If the people are in want, their 
prince cannot enjoy plenty alone.'

雖有粟、吾得而食諸。
        CHAP. X. 1. Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to 
be exalted, and delusions to be discovered, the Master said, 
'Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles, and be 
moving continually to what is right;-- this is the way to exalt 
one's virtue.
        2. 'You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and 
wish him to die. Having wished him to live, you also wish him 
to die. This is a case of delusion.
        3. '"It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you 
come to make a difference."'
        CHAP. XI. 1. The Duke Ching, of Ch'i, asked Confucius 
about government.
        2. Confucius replied, 'There is government, when the 
prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father 
is father, and the son is son.'
        3. 'Good!' said the duke; 'if, indeed; the prince be not 
prince, the minister not minister, the father not father, and the 
son not son, although I have my revenue, can I enjoy it?'

        CHAP. XII. 1. The Master said, 'Ah! it is Yu, who could 
with half a word settle litigations!'
        2. Tsze-lu never slept over a promise.
        CHAP. XIII. The Master said, 'In hearing litigations, I am 
like any other body. What is necessary, however, is to cause 
the people to have no litigations.'
        CHAP. XIV. Tsze-chang asked about government. The 
Master said, 'The art of governing is to keep its affairs before 
the mind without weariness, and to practise them with 
undeviating consistency.'
        CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'By extensively studying all 
learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules 
of propriety, one may thus likewise not err from what is right.'

【十九章】李康子問政於孔子、曰、如殺無道、以就有道、何如。
        CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'The superior man seeks to 
perfect the admirable qualities of men, and does not seek to 
perfect their bad qualities. The mean man does the opposite of 
this.'
        CHAP. XVII. Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government. 
Confucius replied, 'To govern means to rectify. If you lead on 
the people with correctness, who will dare not to be correct?'
        CHAP. XVIII. Chi K'ang, distressed about the number of 
thieves in the state, inquired of Confucius how to do away with 
them. Confucius said, 'If you, sir, were not covetous, although 
you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.'
        CHAP. XIX. Chi K'ang asked Confucius about government, 
saying, 'What do you say to killing the unprincipled for the 
good of the principled?' Confucius replied, 'Sir, in carrying on 
your government, why should you use killing at all? Let your 
evinced desires be for what is good, and the people will be 
good. The relation

between superiors and inferiors, is like that between the wind 
and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows 
across it.'
        CHAP. XX. 1. Tsze-chang asked, 'What must the officer be, 
who may be said to be distinguished?'
        2. The Master said, 'What is it you call being 
distinguished?'
        3. Tsze-chang replied, 'It is to be heard of through the 
State, to be heard of throughout his clan.'
        4. The Master said, 'That is notoriety, not distinction.
        5. 'Now the man of distinction is solid and 
straightforward, and loves righteousness. He examines people's 
words, and looks at their countenances. He is anxious to humble 
himself to others. Such a man will be distinguished in the 
country; he will be distinguished in his clan.
        6. 'As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance 
of

virtue, but his actions are opposed to it, and he rests in this 
character without any doubts about himself. Such a man will be 
heard of in the country; he will be heard of in the clan.'
        CHAP. XXI. 1. Fan Ch'ih rambling with the Master under 
the trees about the rain altars, said, 'I venture to ask how to 
exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, and to discover 
delusions.'
        2. The Master said, 'Truly a good question!
        3. 'If doing what is to be done be made the first business, 
and success a secondary consideration;-- is not this the way to 
exalt virtue? To assail one's own wickedness and not assail that 
of others;-- is not this the way to correct cherished evil? For a 
morning's anger to disregard one's own life, and involve that of 
his parents;-- is not this a case of delusion?'
        CHAP. XXII. 1. Fan Ch'ih asked about benevolence. The 
Master said, 'It is to love all men.' He asked about knowledge. 
The Master said, 'It is to know all men.'

【廿三章】子貢問友。子曰、忠告而善道
        2. Fan Ch'ih did not immediately understand these 
answers.
        3. The Master said, 'Employ the upright and put aside all 
the crooked;-- in this way the crooked can be made to be 
upright.'
        4. Fan Ch'ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, 
'A Little while ago, I had an interview with our Master, and 
asked him about knowledge. He said, 'Employ the upright, and 
put aside all the crooked;-- in this way, the crooked will be 
made to be upright.' What did he mean?'
        5. Tsze-hsia said, 'Truly rich is his saying!
        6. 'Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected 
from among all the people, and employed Kao-yao, on which all 
who were devoid of virtue disappeared. T'ang, being in 
possession of the kingdom, selected from among all the people, 
and employed I Yin, and all who were devoid of virtue 
disappeared.'
        CHAP. XXIII. Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The 
Master said, 'Faithfully admonish your friend, and skillfully 
lead him on. If you find him impracticable, stop. Do not 
disgrace yourself.'

        CHAP. I. 1. Tsze-lu asked about government. The Master 
said, 'Go before the people with your example, and be laborious

        2. He requested further instruction, and was answered, 
'Be not weary (in these things).'
        CHAP. II. 1. Chung-kung, being chief minister to the Head 
of the Chi family, asked about government. The Master said,

first the services of your various officers, pardon small faults, 
and raise to office men of virtue and talents.'
        2. Chung-kung said, 'How shall I know the men of virtue 
and talent, so that I may raise them to office?' He was 
answered, 'Raise to office those whom you know. As to those 
whom you do not know, will others neglect them?'
        CHAP. III. 1. Tsze-lu said, 'The ruler of Wei has been 
waiting for you, in order with you to administer the 
government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?'
        2. The Master replied, 'What is necessary is to rectify 
names.'
        3. 'So, indeed!' said Tsze-lu. 'You are wide of the mark! 
Why must there be such rectification?'
        4. The Master said, 'How uncultivated you are, Yu! A 
superior man, in regard to what he does not know, shows a 
cautious reserve.
        5. 'If names be not correct, language is not in accordance 
with

the truth of things. If language be not in accordance with the 
truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.
        6. 'When affairs cannot be carried on to success, 
proprieties and music will not flourish. When proprieties and 
music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly 
awarded. When punishments are not properly awarded, the 
people do not know how to move hand or foot.
        7. 'Therefore a superior man considers it necessary that 
the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that 
what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the 
superior man requires, is just that in his words there may be 
nothing incorrect.'
        CHAP. IV. 1. Fan Ch'ih requested to be taught husbandry. 
The Master said, 'I am not so good for that as an old 
husbandman.' He

requested also to be taught gardening, and was answered, 'I am 
not so good for that as an old gardener.'
        2. Fan Ch'ih having gone out, the Master said, 'A small 
man, indeed, is Fan Hsu!
        3. If a superior love propriety, the people will not dare 
not to be reverent. If he love righteousness, the people will not 
dare not to submit to his example. If he love good faith, the 
people will not dare not to be sincere. Now, when these things 
obtain, the people from all quarters will come to him, bearing 
their children on their backs;-- what need has he of a 
knowledge of husbandry?'
        CHAP. V. The Master said, 'Though a man may be able to 
recite the three hundred odes, yet if, when intrusted with a 
governmental charge, he knows not how to act, or if, when sent 
to any quarter on a mission, he cannot give his replies 
unassisted, notwithstanding the extent of his learning, of what 
practical use is it?'

        CHAP. VI. The Master said, 'When a prince's personal 
conduct is correct, his government is effective without the 
issuing of orders. If his personal conduct is not correct, he may 
issue orders, but they will not be followed.'
        CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'The governments of Lu and 
Wei are brothers.'
        CHAP. VIII. The Master said of Ching, a scion of the ducal 
family of Wei, that he knew the economy of a family well. 
When he began to have means, he said, 'Ha! here is a 
collection!' When they were a little increased, he said, 'Ha! this 
is complete!' When he had become rich, he said, 'Ha! this is 
admirable!'
        CHAP. IX. 1. When the Master went to Wei, Zan Yu acted 
as driver of his carriage.
        2. The Master observed, 'How numerous are the people!'
        3. Yu said, 'Since they are thus numerous, what more 
shall be done for them?' 'Enrich them,' was the reply.

be done?' The Master said, 'Teach them.'
        CHAP. X. The Master said, 'If there were (any of the 
princes) who would employ me, in the course of twelve 
months, I should have done something considerable. In three 
years, the government would be perfected.'
        CHAP. XI. The Master said, '"If good men were to govern a 
country in succession for a hundred years, they would be able 
to transform the violently bad, and dispense with capital 
punishments." True indeed is this saying!'
        CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'If a truly royal ruler were to 
arise, it would still require a generation, and then virtue would 
prevail.'

        CHAP. XIII. The Master said, 'If a minister make his own 
conduct correct, what difficulty will he have in assisting in 
government? If he cannot rectify himself, what has he to do 
with rectifying others?'
        CHAP. XIV. The disciple Zan returning from the court, the 
Master said to him, 'How are you so late?' He replied, 'We had 
government business.' The Master said, 'It must have been 
family affairs. If there had been government business, though I 
am not now in office, I should have been consulted about it.'
        CHAP. XV. 1. The Duke Ting asked whether there was a 
single sentence which could make a country prosperous. 
Confucius replied, 'Such an effect cannot be expected from one 
sentence.

        2. 'There is a saying, however, which people have-- "To 
be a prince is difficult; to be a minister is not easy."
        3. 'If a ruler knows this,-- the difficulty of being a 
prince,-- may there not be expected from this one sentence the 
prosperity of his country?'
        4. The duke then said, 'Is there a single sentence which 
can ruin a country?' Confucius replied, 'Such an effect as that 
cannot be expected from one sentence. There is, however, the 
saying which people have-- "I have no pleasure in being a 
prince, but only in that no one can offer any opposition to what 
I say!"
        5. 'If a ruler's words be good, is it not also good that no 
one oppose them? But if they are not good, and no one opposes 
them, may there not be expected from this one sentence the 
ruin of his country?'
        CHAP. XVI. 1. The Duke of Sheh asked about government.
        2. The Master said, 'Good government obtains, when those 
who are near are made happy, and those who are far off are

        CHAP. XVII. Tsze-hsia, being governor of Chu-fu, asked 
about government. The Master said, 'Do not be desirous to have 
things done quickly; do not look at small advantages. Desire to 
have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly. 
Looking at small advantages prevents great affairs from being 
accomplished.'
        CHAP. XVIII. 1. The Duke of Sheh informed Confucius, 
saying, 'Among us here there are those who may be styled 
upright in their conduct. If their father have stolen a sheep, 
they will bear witness to the fact.'
        2. Confucius said, 'Among us, in our part of the country, 
those who are upright are different from this. The father 
conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the 
misconduct of the father. Uprightness is to be found in this.'

        CHAP. XIX. Fan Ch'ih asked about perfect virtue. The 
Master said, 'It is, in retirement, to be sedately grave; in the 
management of business, to be reverently attentive; in 
intercourse with others, to be strictly sincere. Though a man go 
among rude, uncultivated tribes, these qualities may not be 
neglected.'
        CHAP. XX. 1. Tsze-kung asked, saying, 'What qualities 
must a man possess to entitle him to be called an officer? The 
Master said, 'He who in his conduct of himself maintains a 
sense of shame, and when sent to any quarter will not disgrace 
his prince's commission, deserves to be called an officer.'
        3. Tsze-kung pursued, 'I venture to ask who may be 
placed in the next lower rank?' And he was told, 'He whom the 
circle of his relatives pronounce to be filial, whom his fellow-
villagers and neighbours pronounce to be fraternal.'
        3. Again the disciple asked, 'I venture to ask about the 
class still next in order.' The Master said, 'They are determined 
to be sincere in what they say, and to carry out what they do. 
They are obstinate little men. Yet perhaps they may make the 
next class.'

        4. Tsze-kung finally inquired, 'Of what sort are those of 
the present day, who engage in government?' The Master said 
'Pooh! they are so many pecks and hampers, not worth being 
taken into account.'
        CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'Since I cannot get men 
pursuing the due medium, to whom I might communicate my 
instructions, I must find the ardent and the cautiously-decided. 
The ardent will advance and lay hold of truth; the cautiously-
decided will keep themselves from what is wrong.'
        CHAP. XXII. 1. The Master said, 'The people of the south 
have a saying-- "A man without constancy cannot be either a 
wizard or a doctor." Good!

affable, but not adulatory; the mean man is adulatory, but not 
affable.'
        CHAP. XXIV. Tsze-kung asked, saying, 'What do you say 
of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood?' 
The Master replied, 'We may not for that accord our approval 
of him.' 'And what do you say of him who is hated by all the 
people of his neighborhood?' The Master said, 'We may not for 
that conclude that he is bad. It is better than either of these 
cases that the good in the neighborhood love him, and the bad 
hate him.'
        CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'The superior man is easy to 
serve and difficult to please. If you try to please him in any 
way which is not accordant with right, he will not be pleased. 
But in his

employment of men, he uses them according to their capacity. 
The mean man is difficult to serve, and easy to please. If you 
try to please him, though it be in a way which is not accordant 
with right, he may be pleased. But in his employment of men, 
he wishes them to be equal to everything.'
        CHAP. XXVI. The Master said, 'The superior man has a 
dignified ease without pride. The mean man has pride without 
a dignified ease.'
        CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'The firm, the enduring, 
the simple, and the modest are near to virtue.'
        CHAP. XXVIII. Tsze-lu asked, saying, 'What qualities must 
a man possess to entitle him to be called a scholar?' The Master 
said, 'He must be thus,-- earnest, urgent, and bland:-- among 
his friends, earnest and urgent; among his brethren, bland.'

BOOK XIV. HSIEN WAN.

【第一章】憲問恥。子曰、邦有道穀、邦無道穀、恥也。
        CHAP. I. Hsien asked what was shameful. The Master 
said, 'When good government prevails in a state, to be thinking 
only of salary; and, when bad government prevails, to be 
thinking, in the same way, only of salary;-- this is shameful.'

        CHAP. II. 1. 'When the love of superiority, boasting, 
resentments, and covetousness are repressed, this may be 
deemed perfect virtue.'
        2. The Master said, 'This may be regarded as the 
achievement of what is difficult. But I do not know that it is to 
be deemed perfect virtue.'
        CHAP. III. The Master said, 'The scholar who cherishes 
the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.'
        CHAP. IV. The Master said, 'When good government 
prevails in a state, language may be lofty and bold, and actions 
the same. When bad government prevails, the actions may be 
lofty and bold, but the language may be with some reserve.'
        CHAP. V. The Master said, 'The virtuous will be sure to 
speak correctly, but those whose speech is good may not 
always be virtuous. Men of principle are sure to be bold, but 
those who are bold may not always be men of principle.'

        CHAP. VI. Nan-kung Kwo, submitting an inquiry to 
Confucius, said, 'I was skillful at archery, and Ao could move a 
boat along upon the land, but neither of them died a natural 
death. Yu and Chi personally wrought at the toils of husbandry, 
and they became possessors of the kingdom.' The Master made 
no reply; but when Nan-kung Kwo went out, he said, 'A 
superior man indeed is this! An esteemer of virtue indeed is 
this!'
        CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'Superior men, and yet not 
always virtuous, there have been, alas! But there never has 
been a mean man, and, at the same time, virtuous.'

        CHAP. VIII. The Master said, 'Can there be love which 
does not lead to strictness with its object? Can there be loyalty 
which does not lead to the instruction of its object?'
        CHAP. IX. The Master said, 'In preparing the 
governmental notifications, P'i Shan first made the rough 
draught; Shi-shu examined and discussed its contents; Tsze-yu, 
the manager of Foreign intercourse, then polished the style; 
and, finally, Tsze-ch'an of Tung-li gave it the proper elegance 
and finish.'
        CHAP. X. 1. Some one asked about Tsze-ch'an. The Master 
said, 'He was a kind man.'
        2. He asked about Tsze-hsi. The Master said, 'That man! 
That man!'
        3. He asked about Kwan Chung. 'For him,' said the Master, 
'the city of Pien, with three hundred families, was taken from 
the chief of the Po family, who did not utter a murmuring 
word, though, to the end of his life, he had only coarse rice to 
eat.'

        CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'To be poor without 
murmuring is difficult. To be rich without being proud is easy.'
        CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'Mang Kung-ch'o is more than 
fit to be chief officer in the families of Chao and Wei, but he is 
not fit to be great officer to either of the States Tang or Hsieh.'
        CHAP. XIII. 1. Tsze-lu asked what constituted a 
COMPLETE man. The Master said, 'Suppose a man with the 
knowledge of Tsang Wu-chung, the freedom from covetousness 
of Kung-ch'o, the bravery of Chwang of Pien, and the varied 
talents of Zan Ch'iu; add to these the accomplishments of the 
rules of propriety and music:-- such a one might be reckoned a 
COMPLETE man.'
        2. He then added, 'But what is the necessity for a 
complete man of the present day to have all these things? The 
man, who in the

view of gain, thinks of righteousness; who in the view of 
danger is prepared to give up his life; and who does not forget 
an old agreement however far back it extends:-- such a man 
may be reckoned a COMPLETE man.'
        CHAP. XIV. 1. The Master asked Kung-ming Chia about 
Kung-shu Wan, saying, 'Is it true that your master speaks not, 
laughs not, and takes not?'
        2. Kung-ming Chia replied, 'This has arisen from the 
reporters going beyond the truth.-- My master speaks when it 
is the time to speak, and so men do not get tired of his 
speaking. He laughs when there is occasion to be joyful, and so 
men do not get tired of his laughing. He takes when it is 
consistent with righteousness to do so, and so men do not get 
tired of his taking.' The Master said, 'So! But is it so with him?'

        CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'Tsang Wu-chung, keeping 
possession of Fang, asked of the duke of Lu to appoint a 
successor to him in his family. Although it may be said that he 
was not using force with his sovereign, I believe he was.'
        CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'The duke Wan of Tsin was 
crafty and not upright. The duke Hwan of Ch'i was upright and 
not crafty.'
        CHAP. XVII. 1. Tsze-lu said, 'The Duke Hwan caused his 
brother Chiu to be killed, when Shao Hu died with his master, 
but Kwan Chung did not die. May not I say that he was wanting 
in virtue?'

        2. The Master said, 'The Duke Hwan assembled all the 
princes together, and that not with weapons of war and 
chariots:-- it was all through the influence of Kwan Chung. 
Whose beneficence was like his? Whose beneficence was like 
his?'
        CHAP. XVIII. 1. Tsze-kung said, 'Kwan Chung, I 
apprehend, was wanting in virtue. When the Duke Hwan 
caused his brother Chiu to be killed, Kwan Chung was not able 
to die with him. Moreover, he became prime minister to Hwan.'
        2. The Master said, 'Kwan Chung acted as prime minister 
to the Duke Hwan, made him leader of all the princes, and 
united and rectified the whole kingdom. Down to the present 
day, the people enjoy the gifts which he conferred. But for 
Kwan Chung, we should now be wearing our hair unbound, and 
the lappets of our coats buttoning on the left side.

family-minister to Kung-shu Wan, ascended to the prince's 
court in company with Wan.
        2. The Master, having heard of it, said, 'He deserved to be 
considered WAN (the accomplished).'
        CHAP. XX. 1. The Master was speaking about the 
unprincipled course of the duke Ling of Wei, when Ch'i K'ang 
said, 'Since he is of such a character, how is it he does not lose 
his State?'
        2. Confucius said, 'The Chung-shu Yu has the 
superintendence of his guests and of strangers; the litanist, T'o,

he lose his State?'
        CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'He who speaks without 
modesty will find it difficult to make his words good.'
        CHAP. XXII. 1. Chan Ch'ang murdered the Duke Chien of 
Ch'i.
        2. Confucius bathed, went to court, and informed the 
duke Ai, saying, 'Chan Hang has slain his sovereign. I beg that 
you will undertake to punish him.'
        3. The duke said, 'Inform the chiefs of the three families 
of it.'
        4. Confucius retired, and said, 'Following in the rear of the 
great officers, I did not dare not to represent such a matter, 
and my prince says, "Inform the chiefs of the three families of 
it."'

The Master said, 'Do not impose on him, and, moreover,

men together. The Master said, 'Tsze must have reached a high

men's not knowing me; I will be concerned at my own want of 
ability.'
        CHAP. XXXIII. The Master said, 'He who does not 
anticipate attempts to deceive him, nor think beforehand of his

        CHAP. XXXVIII. 1. The Kung-po Liao, having slandered 
Tsze-lu to Chi-sun, Tsze-fu Ching-po informed Confucius of it,

Liao, but I have still power enough left to cut Liao off, and 
expose his corpse in the market and in the court.'
        2. The Master said, 'If my principles are to advance, it is 
so ordered. If they are to fall to the ground, it is so ordered. 
What can the Kung-po Liao do where such ordering is 
concerned?'

of the house where Confucius was, and said, 'His heart is full 
who so beats the musical stone.'
        2. A little while after, he added, 'How contemptible is the 
one-ideaed obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken 
no notice of, he has simply at once to give over his wish for 
public employment. "Deep water must be crossed with the 
clothes on; shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held 
up."'
        3. The Master said, 'How determined is he in his purpose! 
But this is not difficult!'
        CHAP. XLIII. 1. Tsze-chang said, 'What is meant when the 
Shu says that Kao-tsung, while observing the usual imperial 
mourning, was for three years without speaking?'
        2. The Master said, 'Why must Kao-tsung be referred to 
as an example of this? The ancients all did so. When the 
sovereign died, the officers all attended to their several duties, 
taking instructions from the prime minister for three years.'

        CHAP. XLIV. The Master said, 'When rulers love to 
observe the rules of propriety, the people respond readily to 
the calls on them for service.'
        CHAP. XLV. Tsze-lu asked what constituted the superior 
man. The Master said, 'The cultivation of himself in reverential 
carefulness.' 'And is this all?' said Tsze-lu. 'He cultivates 
himself so as to give rest to others,' was the reply. 'And is this 
all?' again asked Tsze-lu. The Master said, 'He cultivates 
himself so as to give rest to all the people. He cultivates himself 
so as to give rest to all the people:-- even Yao and Shun were 
still solicitous about this.'
        CHAP. XLVI. Yuan Zang was squatting on his heels, and

so waited the approach of the Master, who said to him, 'In 
youth not humble as befits a junior; in manhood, doing nothing 
worthy of being handed down; and living on to old age:-- this is 
to be a pest.' With this he hit him on the shank with his staff.
        CHAP. XLVI. 1. A youth of the village of Ch'ueh was 
employed by Confucius to carry the messages between him and 
his visitors. Some one asked about him, saying, 'I suppose he 
has made great progress.'
        2. The Master said, 'I observe that he is fond of occupying 
the seat of a full-grown man; I observe that he walks shoulder 
to shoulder with his elders. He is not one who is seeking to 
make progress in learning. He wishes quickly to become a man.'

        CHAP. I. 1. The Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about 
tactics. Confucius replied, 'I have heard all about sacrificial 
vessels, but I have not learned military matters.' On this, he 
took his departure the next day.
        2. When he was in Chan, their provisions were exhausted, 
and his followers became so ill that they were unable to rise.
        3. Tsze-lu, with evident dissatisfaction, said, 'Has the 
superior man likewise to endure in this way?' The Master said, 
'The superior man may indeed have to endure want, but the 
mean man, when he is in want, gives way to unbridled license.'

        CHAP. II. 1. The Master said, 'Ts'ze, you think, I suppose, 
that I am one who learns many things and keeps them in 
memory?'
        2. Tsze-kung replied, 'Yes,-- but perhaps it is not so?'
        3. 'No,' was the answer; 'I seek a unity all-pervading.'
        CHAP. III. The Master said, 'Yu, those who know virtue 
are few.'
        CHAP. IV. The Master said, 'May not Shun be instanced as 
having governed efficiently without exertion? What did he do? 
He did nothing but gravely and reverently occupy his royal 
seat.'
        CHAP. V. 1. Tsze-chang asked how a man should conduct 
himself, so as to be everywhere appreciated.
        2. The Master said, 'Let his words be sincere and truthful, 
and his actions honourable and careful;-- such conduct may be 
practised among the rude tribes of the South or the North. If 
his words be

not sincere and truthful and his actions not honourable and 
careful, will he, with such conduct, be appreciated, even in his 
neighborhood?
        3. 'When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it 
were, fronting him. When he is in a carriage, let him see them 
attached to the yoke. Then may he subsequently carry them 
into practice.'
        4. Tsze-chang wrote these counsels on the end of his sash.
        CHAP. VI. 1. The Master said, 'Truly straightforward was 
the historiographer Yu. When good government prevailed in his 
State, he was like an arrow. When bad government prevailed, 
he was like an arrow.
        2. A superior man indeed is Chu Po-yu! When good 
government prevails in his state, he is to be found in office. 
When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, 
and keep them in his breast.'

        CHAP. VII. The Master said, 'When a man may be spoken 
with, not to speak to him is to err in reference to the man. 
When a man may not be spoken with, to speak to him is to err 
in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard to 
their man nor to their words.'
        CHAP. VIII. The Master said, 'The determined scholar and 
the man of virtue will not seek to live at the expense of 
injuring their virtue. They will even sacrifice their lives to 
preserve their virtue complete.'
        CHAP. IX. Tsze-kung asked about the practice of virtue. 
The Master said, 'The mechanic, who wishes to do his work 
well, must first sharpen his tools. When you are living in any 
state, take service with the most worthy among its great 
officers, and make friends of the most virtuous among its 
scholars.'
        CHAP. X. 1. Yen Yuan asked how the government of a

        CHAP. XI. The Master said, 'If a man take no thought 
about what is distant, he will find sorrow near at hand.'
        CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'It is all over! I have not seen 
one who loves virtue as he loves beauty.'

        CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'He who requires much from 
himself and little from others, will keep himself from being the 
object of resentment.'
        CHAP. XV. The Master said, 'When a man is not in the 
habit of saying-- "What shall I think of this? What shall I think 
of this?" I can indeed do nothing with him!'
        CHAP. XVI. The Master said, 'When a number of people 
are together, for a whole day, without their conversation 
turning on righteousness, and when they are fond of carrying 
out the suggestions of a small shrewdness;-- theirs is indeed a 
hard case.'
        CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'The superior man in 
everything considers righteousness to be essential. He performs 
it according to the rules of propriety. He brings it forth in 
humility. He completes it with sincerity. This is indeed a 
superior man.'

not knowing him.'
        CHAP. XIX. The Master said, 'The superior man dislikes 
the thought of his name not being mentioned after his death.'
        CHAP. XX. The Master said, 'What the superior man seeks, 
is in himself. What the mean man seeks, is in others.'
        CHAP. XXI. The Master said, 'The superior man is 
dignified, but does not wrangle. He is sociable, but not a 
partizan.'
        CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'The superior man does not 
promote a man simply on account of his words, nor does he put 
aside good words because of the man.'

        CHAP. XXIII. Tsze-kung asked, saying, 'Is there one word 
which may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life?' The 
Master said, 'Is not RECIPROCITY such a word? What you do not 
want done to yourself, do not do to others.'
        CHAP. XXIV. 1. The Master said, 'In my dealings with 
men, whose evil do I blame, whose goodness do I praise, 
beyond what is proper? If I do sometimes exceed in praise, 
there must be ground for it in my examination of the 
individual.
        2. 'This people supplied the ground why the three 
dynasties pursued the path of straightforwardness.'
        CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'Even in my early days, a 
historiographer would leave a blank in his text, and he who 
had a horse would lend him to another to ride. Now, alas! there 
are no such things.'

        CHAP. XXVI. The Master said, 'Specious words confound 
virtue. Want of forbearance in small matters confounds great 
plans.'
        CHAP. XXVII. The Master said, 'When the multitude hate 
a man, it is necessary to examine into the case. When the 
multitude like a man, it is necessary to examine into the case.'
        CHAP. XXVIII. The Master said, 'A man can enlarge the 
principles which he follows; those principles do not enlarge the 
man.'
        CHAP. XXIX. The Master said, 'To have faults and not to 
reform them,-- this, indeed, should be pronounced having 
faults.'

without eating, and the whole night without sleeping:-- 
occupied with thinking. It was of no use. The better plan is to 
learn.'
        CHAP. XXXI. The Master said, 'The object of the superior 
man is truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;-- even in 
that there is sometimes want. So with learning;-- emolument 
may be found in it. The superior man is anxious lest he should 
not get truth; he is not anxious lest poverty should come upon 
him.'
        CHAP. XXXII. 1. The Master said, 'When a man's 
knowledge is sufficient to attain, and his virtue is not sufficient 
to enable him to hold, whatever he may have gained, he will 
lose again.
        2. 'When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has 
virtue enough to hold fast, if he cannot govern with dignity, the 
people will not respect him.
        3. 'When his knowledge is sufficient to attain, and he has 
virtue enough to hold fast; when he governs also with dignity, 
yet if he try to move the people contrary to the rules of 
propriety:-- full excellence is not reached.'

【卅五章】子曰、當仁、不讓於師。
        CHAP. XXXIII. The Master said, 'The superior man cannot 
be known in little matters; but he may be intrusted with great 
concerns. The small man may not be intrusted with great 
concerns, but he may be known in little matters.'
        CHAP. XXXIV. The Master said, 'Virtue is more to man 
than either water or fire. I have seen men die from treading on 
water and fire, but I have never seen a man die from treading 
the course of virtue.'
        CHAP. XXXV. The Master said, 'Let every man consider 
virtue as what devolves on himself. He may not yield the 
performance of it even to his teacher.'

        CHAP. XXXVI. The Master said, 'The superior man is 
correctly firm, and not firm merely.'
        CHAP. XXXVII. The Master said, 'A minister, in serving his 
prince, reverently discharges his duties, and makes his 
emolument a secondary consideration.'
        CHAP. XXXVIII. The Master said, 'In teaching there 
should be no distinction of classes.'
        CHAP. XXXIX. The Master said, 'Those whose courses are 
different cannot lay plans for one another.'
        CHAP. XL. The Master said, 'In language it is simply 
required that it convey the meaning.'
        CHAP. XLI. 1. The Music-master, Mien, having called upon 
him, when they came to the steps, the Master said, 'Here are

he

said, 'Here is the mat.' When all were seated, the Master 
informed him, saying, 'So and so is here; so and so is here.'
        2. The Music-master, Mien, having gone out, Tsze-chang 
asked, saying. 'Is it the rule to tell those things to the Music-
master?' 
        3. The Master said, 'Yes. This is certainly the rule for 
those who lead the blind.'

【第一章】【一節】李氏將伐顓臾。【二節】冉有李路見於孔子曰、李氏將
有事於顓臾。
        CHAP. I. 1. The head of the Chi family was going to attack 
Chwan-yu.
        2. Zan Yu and Chi-lu had an interview with Confucius, and 
said, 'Our chief, Chi, is going to commence operations against 
Chwan-yu.'

【三節】孔子曰、求、無乃爾是過與。【四節】夫顓臾、昔者、先王以為東

虎兕出於柙、龜玉毀於
        3. Confucius said, 'Ch'iu, is it not you who are in fault 
here?
        4. 'Now, in regard to Chwan-yu, long ago, a former king 
appointed its ruler to preside over the sacrifices to the eastern 
Mang; moreover, it is in the midst of the territory of our State; 
and its ruler is a minister in direct connexion with the 
sovereign:-- What has your chief to do with attacking it?'
        5. Zan Yu said, 'Our master wishes the thing; neither of us 
two ministers wishes it.'
        6. Confucius said, 'Ch'iu, there are the words of Chau 
Zan,-- "When he can put forth his ability, he takes his place in 
the ranks of office; when he finds himself unable to do so, he 
retires from it. How can he be used as a guide to a blind man, 
who does not support him when tottering, nor raise him up 
when fallen?"
        7. 'And further, you speak wrongly. When a tiger or 
rhinoceros escapes from his cage; when a tortoise or piece of 
jade is injured in its repository:-- whose is the fault?'

        8. Zan Yu said, 'But at present, Chwan-yu is strong and 
near to Pi; if our chief do not now take it, it will hereafter be a 
sorrow to his descendants.'
        9. Confucius said. 'Ch'iu, the superior man hates that 
declining to say-- "I want such and such a thing," and framing 
explanations for the conduct.
        10. 'I have heard that rulers of States and chiefs of 
families are not troubled lest their people should be few, but 
are troubled lest they should not keep their several places; that 
they are not troubled with fears of poverty, but are troubled 
with fears of a want of contented repose among the people in 
their several places. For when the people keep their several 
places, there will be no poverty; when harmony prevails, there 
will be no scarcity of people; and when there is such a 
contented repose, there will be no rebellious upsettings.
        11. 'So it is.-- Therefore, if remoter people are not 
submissive, all

the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to 
attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, 
they must be made contented and tranquil.
        12. 'Now, here are you, Yu and Ch'iu, assisting your chief. 
Remoter people are not submissive, and, with your help, he 
cannot attract them to him. In his own territory there are 
divisions and downfalls, leavings and separations, and, with 
your help, he cannot preserve it.
        13. 'And yet he is planning these hostile movements 
within the State.-- I am afraid that the sorrow of the Chi-sun 
family will not be on account of Chwan-yu, but will be found 
within the screen of their own court.'

【第二章】【一節】孔子曰、天下有道、則禮樂征伐、自天子出、天下無道、
則禮樂征伐、自諸侯出、自諸侯出、蓋十世希不失矣、自大夫出、五世希不

節】天下有道、則庶人不議。
        CHAP. II. 1. Confucius said, 'When good government 
prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and punitive 
military expeditions proceed from the son of Heaven. When 
bad government prevails in the empire, ceremonies, music, and 
punitive military expeditions proceed from the princes. When 
these things proceed from the princes, as a rule, the cases will 
be few in which they do not lose their power in ten 
generations. When they proceed from the Great officers of the 
princes, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not 
lose their power in five generations. When the subsidiary 
ministers of the great officers hold in their grasp the orders of 
the state, as a rule, the cases will be few in which they do not 
lose their power in three generations.
        2. 'When right principles prevail in the kingdom, 
government will not be in the hands of the Great officers.
        3. 'When right principles prevail in the kingdom, there 
will be no discussions among the common people.'

便辟、友善柔、友便佞、損矣。
【第五章】孔子曰、益者三樂、損者三樂、樂節禮樂、
        CHAP. III. Confucius said, 'The revenue of the state has 
left the ducal House now for five generations. The government 
has been in the hands of the Great officers for four generations. 
On this account, the descendants of the three Hwan are much 
reduced.'
        CHAP. IV. Confucius said, 'There are three friendships 
which are advantageous, and three which are injurious. 
Friendship with the upright; friendship with the sincere; and 
friendship with the man of much observation:-- these are 
advantageous. Friendship with the man of specious airs; 
friendship with the insinuatingly soft; and friendship with the 
glib-tongued:-- these are injurious.'
        CHAP. V. Confucius said, 'There are three things men find 
enjoyment in which are advantageous, and three things they 
find enjoyment in which are injurious. To find enjoyment in the 
discriminating study of ceremonies and music; to find 
enjoyment in

樂道人之善、樂多賢友、益矣。樂驕樂、樂佚遊、樂宴樂、損矣。
【第六章】孔子曰、侍於君子有三愆、言未及之而言、謂之躁、言及之而不
言、謂之隱、未見顏色而言、謂之瞽。
【第七章】孔子曰、君子有三戒、少之時、血氣未定、戒之
speaking of the goodness of others; to find enjoyment in having 
many worthy friends:-- these are advantageous. To find 
enjoyment in extravagant pleasures; to find enjoyment in 
idleness and sauntering; to find enjoyment in the pleasures of 
feasting:-- these are injurious.'
        CHAP. VI. Confucius said, 'There are three errors to which 
they who stand in the presence of a man of virtue and station 
are liable. They may speak when it does not come to them to 
speak;-- this is called rashness. They may not speak when it 
comes to them to speak;-- this is called concealment. They may 
speak without looking at the countenance of their superior;-- 
this is called blindness.'
        CHAP. VII. Confucius said, 'There are three things which 
the superior man guards against. In youth, when the physical 
powers

在色、及其壯也、血氣方剛、戒之在鬥、及其老也、血氣既衰、戒之在得。
【第八章】【一節】孔子曰、君子有三畏、畏天命、畏大人、畏聖人之言。
【二節】小人不知天命、而不畏也、狎大人、侮聖人之言。
【第九章】孔子曰、生而知之者、上也、學而知之者、次也、
are not yet settled, he guards against lust. When he is strong 
and the physical powers are full of vigor, he guards against 
quarrelsomeness. When he is old, and the animal powers are 
decayed, he guards against covetousness.'
        CHAP. VIII. 1. Confucius said, 'There are three things of 
which the superior man stands in awe. He stands in awe of the 
ordinances of Heaven. He stands in awe of great men. He stands 
in awe of the words of sages.
        2. 'The mean man does not know the ordinances of 
Heaven, and consequently does not stand in awe of them. He is 
disrespectful to great men. He makes sport of the words of 
sages.'
        CHAP. IX. Confucius said, 'Those who are born with the 
possession of knowledge are the highest class of men. Those 
who learn, and so, readily, get possession of knowledge, are the 
next.

困而學之、又其次也、困而不學、民斯為下矣。

【十一章】【一節】孔子曰、見善如不及、見不善而探湯、吾見其人矣、吾

Those who are dull and stupid, and yet compass the learning, 
are another class next to these. As to those who are dull and 
stupid and yet do not learn;-- they are the lowest of the 
people.'
        CHAP. X. Confucius said, 'The superior man has nine 
things which are subjects with him of thoughtful consideration. 
In regard to the use of his eyes, he is anxious to see clearly. In 
regard to the use of his ears, he is anxious to hear distinctly. In 
regard to his countenance, he is anxious that it should be 
benign. In regard to his demeanor, he is anxious that it should 
be respectful. In regard to his speech, he is anxious that it 
should be sincere. In regard to his doing of business, he is 
anxious that it should be reverently careful. In regard to what 
he doubts about, he is anxious to question others. When he is 
angry, he thinks of the difficulties (his anger may involve him 
in). When he sees gain to be got, he thinks of righteousness.'
        CHAP. XI. 1. Confucius said, 'Contemplating good, and 
pursuing it, as if they could not reach it; contemplating evil, 
and shrinking from it, as they would from thrusting the hand 
into boiling water:-- I have seen such men, as I have heard 
such words.

righteousness to carry out their principles:-- I have heard 
these words, but I have not seen such men.'
        CHAP. XII. 1. The duke Ching of Ch'i had a thousand 
teams, each of four horses, but on the day of his death, the 
people did not praise him for a single virtue. Po-i and Shu-ch'i 
died of hunger at the foot of the Shau-yang mountain, and the 
people, down to the present time, praise them.
        2. 'Is not that saying illustrated by this?'
        CHAP. XIII. 1. Ch'an K'ang asked Po-yu, saying, 'Have you 
heard any lessons from your father different from what we 
have all heard?'
        2. Po-yu replied, 'No. He was standing alone once, when I 
passed below the hall with hasty steps, and said to me, "Have 
you learned the Odes?" On my replying "Not yet," he added, "If 
you do not learn the Odes, you will not be fit to converse with." 
I retired and studied the Odes.

        3. 'Another day, he was in the same way standing alone, 
when I passed by below the hall with hasty steps, and said to 
me, 'Have you learned the rules of Propriety?' On my replying 
'Not yet,' he added, 'If you do not learn the rules of Propriety, 
your character cannot be established.' I then retired, and 
learned the rules of Propriety.
        4. 'I have heard only these two things from him.'
        5. Ch'ang K'ang retired, and, quite delighted, said, 'I asked 
one thing, and I have got three things. I have heard about the 
Odes. I have heard about the rules of Propriety. I have also 
heard that the superior man maintains a distant reserve 
towards his son.'
        CHAP. XIV. The wife of the prince of a state is called by 
him FU ZAN. She calls herself HSIAO T'UNG. The people of the 
State call

        CHAP. I. 1. Yang Ho wished to see Confucius, but 
Confucius would not go to see him. On this, he sent a present of 
a pig to Confucius, who, having chosen a time when Ho was not 
at home, went to pay his respects for the gift. He met him, 
however, on the way.
        2. Ho said to Confucius, 'Come, let me speak with you.' He 
then asked, 'Can he be called benevolent who keeps his jewel in

'No.' 'Can he be called wise, who is anxious to be engaged in 
public employment, and yet is constantly losing the 
opportunity of being so?' Confucius again said, 'No.' 'The days 
and months are passing away; the years do not wait for us.' 
Confucius said, 'Right; I will go into office.'
        CHAP. II. The Master said, 'By nature, men are nearly 
alike; by practice, they get to be wide apart.'
        CHAP. III. The Master said, 'There are only the wise of 
the highest class, and the stupid of the lowest class, who cannot 
be changed.'

        CHAP. IV. 1. The Master, having come to Wu-ch'ang, 
heard there the sound of stringed instruments and singing.
        2. Well pleased and smiling, he said, 'Why use an ox knife 
to kill a fowl?'
        3. Tsze-yu replied, 'Formerly, Master, I heard you say,-- 
"When the man of high station is well instructed, he loves men; 
when the man of low station is well instructed, he is easily 
ruled."'
        4. The Master said, 'My disciples, Yen's words are right. 
What I said was only in sport.'
        CHAP. V. Kung-shan Fu-zao, when he was holding Pi, and 
in an attitude of rebellion, invited the Master to visit him, who 
was rather inclined to go.
        2. Tsze-lu was displeased, and said, 'Indeed, you cannot 
go! Why must you think of going to see Kung-shan?'

        3. The Master said, 'Can it be without some reason that he 
has invited ME? If any one employ me, may I not make an 
eastern Chau?'
        CHAP. VI. Tsze-chang asked Confucius about perfect 
virtue. Confucius said, 'To be able to practise five things 
everywhere under heaven constitutes perfect virtue.' He 
begged to ask what they were, and was told, 'Gravity, 
generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness. If you 
are grave, you will not be treated with disrespect. If you are 
generous, you will win all. If you are sincere, people will repose 
trust in you. If you are earnest, you will accomplish much. If 
you are kind, this will enable you to employ the services of 
others.

        CHAP. VII. 1. Pi Hsi inviting him to visit him, the Master 
was inclined to go.
        2. Tsze-lu said, 'Master, formerly I have heard you say, 
"When a man in his own person is guilty of doing evil, a 
superior man will not associate with him." Pi Hsi is in rebellion, 
holding possession of Chung-mau; if you go to him, what shall 
be said?'
        3. The Master said, 'Yes, I did use these words. But is it 
not said, that, if a thing be really hard, it may be ground 
without being made thin? Is it not said, that, if a thing be really 
white, it may be steeped in a dark fluid without being made 
black?

        CHAP. VIII. 1. The Master said, 'Yu, have you heard the 
six words to which are attached six becloudings?' Yu replied, 'I 
have not.'
        2. 'Sit down, and I will tell them to you.
        3. 'There is the love of being benevolent without the love 
of learning;-- the beclouding here leads to a foolish simplicity. 
There is the love of knowing without the love of learning;-- the 
beclouding here leads to dissipation of mind. There is the love 
of being sincere without the love of learning;-- the beclouding 
here leads to an injurious disregard of consequences. There is 
the love of straightforwardness without the love of learning;--

boldness without the love of learning;-- the beclouding here 
leads to insubordination. There is the love of firmness without 
the love of learning;-- the beclouding here leads to extravagant 
conduct.'

        CHAP. IX. 1. The Master said, 'My children, why do you 
not study the Book of Poetry?
        2. 'The Odes serve to stimulate the mind.
        3. 'They may be used for purposes of self-contemplation.
        4. 'They teach the art of sociability.
        5. 'They show how to regulate feelings of resentment.
        6. 'From them you learn the more immediate duty of 
serving one's father, and the remoter one of serving one's 
prince.
        7. 'From them we become largely acquainted with the 
names of birds, beasts, and plants.'
        CHAP. X. The Master said to Po-yu, 'Do you give yourself 
to the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan. The man who has not 
studied the Chau-nan and the Shao-nan, is like one who stands 
with his face right against a wall. Is he not so?'

        CHAP. XI. The Master said, '"It is according to the rules of 
propriety," they say.-- "It is according to the rules of 
propriety," they say. Are gems and silk all that is meant by 
propriety? "It is music," they say.-- "It is music," they say. Are 
bells and drums all that is meant by music?'
        CHAP. XII. The Master said, 'He who puts on an 
appearance of stern firmness, while inwardly he is weak, is like 
one of the small, mean people;-- yea, is he not like the thief 
who breaks through, or climbs over, a wall?'
        CHAP. XIII. The Master said, 'Your good, careful people of 
the villages are the thieves of virtue.'
        CHAP. XIV. The Master said, 'To tell, as we go along, what 
we have heard on the way, is to cast away our virtue.'

        CHAP. XV. 1. The Master said, 'There are those mean 
creatures! How impossible it is along with them to serve one's 
prince!
        2. 'While they have not got their aims, their anxiety is 
how to get them. When they have got them, their anxiety is lest 
they should lose them.
        3. 'When they are anxious lest such things should be lost, 
there is nothing to which they will not proceed.'
        CHAP. XVI. 1. The Master said, 'Anciently, men had three 
failings, which now perhaps are not to be found.
        2. 'The high-mindedness of antiquity showed itself in a 
disregard of small things; the high-mindedness of the present 
day shows itself in wild license. The stern dignity of antiquity 
showed itself in grave reserve; the stern dignity of the present 
day shows itself in quarrelsome perverseness. The stupidity of 
antiquity showed itself in straightforwardness; the stupidity of 
the present day shows itself in sheer deceit.'

        CHAP. XVII. The Master said, 'Fine words and an 
insinuating appearance are seldom associated with virtue.'
        CHAP. XVIII. The Master said, 'I hate the manner in 
which purple takes away the luster of vermilion. I hate the 
way in which the songs of Chang confound the music of the Ya. 
I hate those who with their sharp mouths overthrow kingdoms 
and families.'
        CHAP. XIX. 1. The Master said, 'I would prefer not 
speaking.'
        2. Tsze-kung said, 'If you, Master, do not speak, what 
shall we, your disciples, have to record?'
        3. The Master said, 'Does Heaven speak? The four seasons 
pursue their courses, and all things are continually being 
produced, but does Heaven say anything?'

        CHAP. XX. Zu Pei wished to see Confucius, but Confucius 
declined, on the ground of being sick, to see him. When the 
bearer of this message went out at the door, (the Master) took 
his lute and sang to it, in order that Pei might hear him.
        CHAP. XXI. 1. Tsai Wo asked about the three years' 
mourning for parents, saying that one year was long enough.
        2. 'If the superior man,' said he, 'abstains for three years 
from the observances of propriety, those observances will be 
quite lost. If for three years he abstains from music, music will 
be ruined.
        3. 'Within a year the old grain is exhausted, and the new 
grain has sprung up, and, in procuring fire by friction, we go 
through all the changes of wood for that purpose. After a 
complete year, the mourning may stop.'
        4. The Master said, 'If you were, after a year, to eat good 
rice, and wear embroidered clothes, would you feel at ease?' 'I 
should,' replied Wo.

予之不仁也、子生三年、然後免於父母之懷、夫三年之喪、天下之通喪也、
予也、有三年之愛於其父母乎。
        5. The Master said, 'If you can feel at ease, do it. But a 
superior man, during the whole period of mourning, does not 
enjoy pleasant food which he may eat, nor derive pleasure 
from music which he may hear. He also does not feel at ease, if 
he is comfortably lodged. Therefore he does not do what you 
propose. But now you feel at ease and may do it.'
        6. Tsai Wo then went out, and the Master said, 'This 
shows Yu's want of virtue. It is not till a child is three years old 
that it is allowed to leave the arms of its parents. And the three 
years' mourning is universally observed throughout the 
empire. Did Yu enjoy the three years' love of his parents?'

【廿四章】【一節】子貢曰、君子亦有惡乎。子曰、有惡、惡稱人之惡者、
惡居下流而訕上
        CHAP. XXII. The Master said, 'Hard is it to deal with him, 
who will stuff himself with food the whole day, without 
applying his mind to anything good! Are there not gamesters 
and chess players? To be one of these would still be better than 
doing nothing at all.'
        CHAP. XXIII. Tsze-lu said, 'Does the superior man esteem 
valour?' The Master said, 'The superior man holds 
righteousness to be of highest importance. A man in a superior 
situation, having valour without righteousness, will be guilty of 
insubordination; one of the lower people having valour without 
righteousness, will commit robbery.'
        CHAP. XXIV. 1. Tsze-kung said, 'Has the superior man his 
hatreds also?' The Master said, 'He has his hatreds. He hates 
those who proclaim the evil of others. He hates the man who,

being in a low station, slanders his superiors. He hates those 
who have valour merely, and are unobservant of propriety. He 
hates those who are forward and determined, and, at the same 
time, of contracted understanding.'
        2. The Master then inquired, 'Ts'ze, have you also your 
hatreds?' Tsze-kung replied, 'I hate those who pry out matters, 
and ascribe the knowledge to their wisdom. I hate those who 
are only not modest, and think that they are valourous. I hate 
those who make known secrets, and think that they are 
straightforward.'
        CHAP. XXV. The Master said, 'Of all people, girls and 
servants are the most difficult to behave to. If you are familiar 
with them, they lose their humility. If you maintain a reserve 
towards them, they are discontented.'
        CHAP. XXVI. The Master said, 'When a man at forty is the 
object of dislike, he will always continue what he is.'

        CHAP. III. The duke Ching of Ch'i, with reference to the 
manner in which he should treat Confucius, said, 'I cannot treat 
him as I would the chief of the Chi family. I will treat him in a 
manner between that accorded to the chief of the Chi, and that 
given to the chief of the Mang family.' He also said, 'I am old; I 
cannot use his doctrines.' Confucius took his departure.
        CHAP. IV. The people of Ch'i sent to Lu a present of 
female musicians, which Chi Hwan received, and for three days 
no court was held. Confucius took his departure.

future may still be provided against. Give up your vain pursuit. 
Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage 
in affairs of government.'
        2. Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, 
but Chieh-yu hastened away, so that he could not talk with 
him.
        CHAP. VI. 1. Ch'ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the 
field together, when Confucius passed by them, and sent Tsze-
lu to inquire for the ford.
        2. Ch'ang-tsu said, 'Who is he that holds the reins in the 
carriage there?' Tsze-lu told him, 'It is K'ung Ch'iu.' 'Is it not 
K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?' asked he. 'Yes,' was the reply, to which the 
other rejoined, 'He knows the ford.'
        3. Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, 
'Who

are you, sir?' He answered, 'I am Chung Yu.' 'Are you not the 
disciple of K'ung Ch'iu of Lu?' asked the other. 'I am,' replied 
he, and then Chieh-ni said to him, 'Disorder, like a swelling 
flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who is he that will 
change its state for you? Than follow one who merely 
withdraws from this one and that one, had you not better 
follow those who have withdrawn from the world altogether?' 
With this he fell to covering up the seed, and proceeded with 
his work, without stopping.
        4. Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the 
Master observed with a sigh, 'It is impossible to associate with 
birds and beasts, as if they were the same with us. If I 
associate not with these people,-- with mankind,-- with whom

empire, there would be no use for me to change its state.'

        CHAP. VII. 1. Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to 
fall behind, when he met an old man, carrying across his 
shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lu said to him, 
'Have you seen my master, sir!' The old man replied, 'Your four 
limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five 
kinds of grain:-- who is your master?' With this, he planted his 
staff in the ground, and proceeded to weed.
        2. Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood 
before him.
        3. The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his 
house, killed a fowl, prepared millet, and feasted him. He also 
introduced to him his two sons.
        4. Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his 
adventure. The Master said, 'He is a recluse,' and sent Tsze-lu 
back to see him again, but when he got to the place, the old 
man was gone.
        5. Tsze-lu then said to the family, 'Not to take office is not

無義。長幼之節、不可廢也、君臣之義、如之何其廢之、欲潔其身、而亂大
倫、君子之仕也、行其義也、道之不行、已知之矣。

righteous. If the relations between old and young may not be 
neglected, how is it that he sets aside the duties that should be 
observed between sovereign and minister? Wishing to 
maintain his personal purity, he allows that great relation to 
come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performs 
the righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right 
principles to make progress, he is aware of that.'
        CHAP. VIII. 1. The men who have retired to privacy from 
the world have been Po-i, Shu-ch'i, Yu-chung, I-yi, Chu-chang, 
Hui of Liu-hsia, and Shao-lien.
        2. The Master said, 'Refusing to surrender their wills, or 
to submit to any taint in their persons;-- such, I think, were 
Po-i and Shu-ch'i.
        3. 'It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia, and of Shao-lien, that 
they surrendered their wills, and submitted to taint in their 
persons,

but their words corresponded with reason, and their actions 
were such as men are anxious to see. This is all that is to be 
remarked in them.
        4. 'It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they 
hid themselves in their seclusion, they gave a license to their 
words; but, in their persons, they succeeded in preserving their 
purity, and, in their retirement, they acted according to the 
exigency of the times.
        5. 'I am different from all these. I have no course for 
which I am predetermined, and no course against which I am 
predetermined.'
        CHAP. IX. 1. The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch'i.
        2. Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went 
to Ch'u. Liao, the band master at the third meal, went to Ts'ai. 
Chueh, the band master at the fourth meal, went to Ch'in.
        3. Fang-shu, the drum master, withdrew to the north of 
the river.

        4. Wu, the master of the hand drum, withdrew to the 
Han.
        5. Yang, the assistant music master, and Hsiang, master of 
the musical stone, withdrew to an island in the sea.
        CHAP. X. The duke of Chau addressed his son, the duke of 
Lu, saying, 'The virtuous prince does not neglect his relations. 
He does not cause the great ministers to repine at his not 
employing them. Without some great cause, he does not dismiss 
from their offices the members of old families. He does not 
seek in one man talents for every employment.'
        CHAP. XI. To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, 
Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu, Shu-ya, Shu-hsia, Chi-sui, and 
Chi-kwa.

子張第十九
BOOK XIX. TSZE-CHANG.

【第一章】子張曰、士、見危致命、見得思義、祭思敬、喪思哀、其可已矣。
【第二章】子張曰、執德不弘、信道不篤、焉能為有、焉能為亡。
        CHAP. I. Tsze-chang said, 'The scholar, trained for public 
duty, seeing threatening danger, is prepared to sacrifice his life. 
When the opportunity of gain is presented to him, he thinks of 
righteousness. In sacrificing, his thoughts are reverential. In 
mourning, his thoughts are about the grief which he should 
feel. Such a man commands our approbation indeed.'
        CHAP. II. Tsze-chang said, 'When a man holds fast to 
virtue, but without seeking to enlarge it, and believes right 
principles, but without firm sincerity, what account can be 
made of his existence or non-existence?'

【第三章】子夏之門人問交於子張。子張曰、子夏云何。對曰、子夏曰、可
者與之、其不可者拒之。子張曰、異乎吾所聞、君子尊賢而容眾、嘉善而矜
不能、我之大賢與、於人何所不容、我之不賢與、人將拒我、如之何其拒人
也。
【第四章】子夏曰、雖小道、必有
        CHAP. III. The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang 
about the principles that should characterize mutual 
intercourse. Tsze-chang asked, 'What does Tsze-hsia say on the 
subject?' They replied, 'Tsze-hsia says:-- "Associate with those 
who can advantage you. Put away from you those who cannot 
do so."' Tsze-chang observed, 'This is different from what I 
have learned. The superior man honours the talented and 
virtuous, and bears with all. He praises the good, and pities the 
incompetent. Am I possessed of great talents and virtue?-- 
who is there among men whom I will not bear with? Am I 
devoid of talents and virtue?-- men will put me away from 
them. What have we to do with the putting away of others?'
        CHAP. IV. Tsze-hsia said, 'Even in inferior studies and 
employments there is something worth being looked at; but if 
it be

可觀者焉、致遠恐泥、是以君子不為也。
【第五章】子夏曰、日知其所亡、月無忘其所能、可謂好學也已矣。
【第六章】子夏曰、博學而篤志、切問而近思、仁在其中矣。
【第七章】子夏曰、百工居肆、以成其事、君子學以致其道。
attempted to carry them out to what is remote, there is a 
danger of their proving inapplicable. Therefore, the superior 
man does not practise them.'
        CHAP. V. Tsze-hsia said, 'He, who from day to day 
recognises what he has not yet, and from month to month does 
not forget what he has attained to, may be said indeed to love 
to learn.'
        CHAP. VI. Tsze-hsia said, 'There are learning extensively, 
and having a firm and sincere aim; inquiring with earnestness, 
and reflecting with self-application:-- virtue is in such a 
course.'
        CHAP. VII. Tsze-hsia said, 'Mechanics have their shops to 
dwell in, in order to accomplish their works. The superior man 
learns, in order to reach to the utmost of his principles.'

【第八章】子夏曰、小人之過也、必文。
【第九章】子夏曰、君子有三變、望之儼然、即之也溫、聽其言也厲。
【第十章】子夏曰、君子信而後勞其民、未信、則以為厲己也、信而後諫、
未信、則以為謗己也。
【十一章】子夏曰、大德不踰閑、
        CHAP. VIII. Tsze-hsia said, 'The mean man is sure to gloss 
his faults.'
        CHAP. IX. Tsze-hsia said, 'The superior man undergoes 
three changes. Looked at from a distance, he appears stern; 
when approached, he is mild; when he is heard to speak, his 
language is firm and decided.'
        CHAP. X. Tsze-hsia said, 'The superior man, having 
obtained their confidence, may then impose labours on his 
people. If he have not gained their confidence, they will think 
that he is oppressing them. Having obtained the confidence of 
his prince, one may then remonstrate with him. If he have not 
gained his confidence, the prince will think that he is vilifying 
him.'
        CHAP. XI. Tsze-hsia said, 'When a person does not 
transgress the boundary line in the great virtues, he may pass 
and repass it in the small virtues.'

小德出入可也。
【十二章】【一節】子游曰、子夏之門人小子、當洒掃、應對、進退、則可

子之道、孰先傳焉、孰後倦焉、譬諸草木、區以別矣、君子之道、焉可誣也、
有始有卒者、其惟聖人乎。
        CHAP. XII. 1. Tsze-yu said, 'The disciples and followers of 
Tsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering 
and replying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently 
accomplished. But these are only the branches of learning, and 
they are left ignorant of what is essential.-- How can they be 
acknowledged as sufficiently taught?'
        2. Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, 'Alas! Yen Yu 
is wrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, 
what departments are there which he considers of prime 
importance, and delivers? what are there which he considers of 
secondary importance, and allows himself to be idle about? But 
as in the case of plants, which are assorted according to their 
classes, so he deals with his disciples. How can the way of a 
superior man be such as to make fools of any of them? Is it not 
the sage alone, who can unite in one the beginning and the 
consummation of learning?'

【十三章】子夏曰、仕而優則學、學而優則仕。
【十四章】子游曰、喪致乎哀而止。

【十六章】曾子曰、堂堂乎張也、難與並為仁矣。
【十七章】曾子曰、吾聞諸夫子、人未有自致者也、必也親喪乎。
        CHAP. XIII. Tsze-hsia said, 'The officer, having discharged 
all his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, 
having completed his learning, should apply himself to be an 
officer.'
        CHAP. XIV. Tsze-hsia said, 'Mourning, having been carried 
to the utmost degree of grief, should stop with that.'
        CHAP. XV. Tsze-hsia said, 'My friend Chang can do things 
which are hard to be done, but yet he is not perfectly virtuous.'
        CHAP. XVI. The philosopher Tsang said, 'How imposing is 
the manner of Chang! It is difficult along with him to practise 
virtue.'
        CHAP. XVII. The philosopher Tsang said, 'I heard this 
from our Master:-- "Men may not have shown what is in them 
to the full extent, and yet they will be found to do so, on 
occasion of mourning for their parents."'

如得其情、則哀矜而勿喜。
【二十章】子貢曰、紂之不善、不如是之甚也、是以君子
        CHAP. XVIII. The philosopher Tsang said, 'I have heard 
this from our Master:-- "The filial piety of Mang Chwang, in 
other matters, was what other men are competent to, but, as 
seen in his not changing the ministers of his father, nor his 
father's mode of government, it is difficult to be attained to."'
        CHAP. XIX. The chief of the Mang family having 
appointed Yang Fu to be chief criminal judge, the latter 
consulted the philosopher Tsang. Tsang said, 'The rulers have 
failed in their duties, and the people consequently have been 
disorganised, for a long time. When you have found out the 
truth of any accusation, be grieved for and pity them, and do 
not feel joy at your own ability.'
        CHAP. XX. Tsze-kung said, 'Chau's wickedness was not so 
great as that name implies. Therefore, the superior man hates 
to dwell

惡居下流、天下之惡皆歸焉。
【廿一章】子貢曰、君子之過也、如日月之食焉、過也、人皆見之、更也、
人皆仰之。
【廿二章】【一節】衛公孫朝問於子貢曰、仲尼焉學。【二節】子貢曰、文

道焉、夫子焉不學、而亦何常師之有、
in a low-lying situation, where all the evil of the world will 
flow in upon him.'
        CHAP. XXI. Tsze-kung said, 'The faults of the superior 
man are like the eclipses of the sun and moon. He has his 
faults, and all men see them; he changes again, and all men 
look up to him.'
        CHAP. XXII. 1. Kung-sun Ch'ao of Wei asked Tsze-kung, 
saying, 'From whom did Chung-ni get his learning?'
        2. Tsze-kung replied, 'The doctrines of Wan and Wu have 
not yet fallen to the ground. They are to be found among men. 
Men of talents and virtue remember the greater principles of 
them, and others, not possessing such talents and virtue, 
remember the smaller. Thus, all possess the doctrines of Wan 
and Wu. Where could our Master go that he should not have an 
opportunity of learning them? And yet what necessity was 
there for his having a regular master?'

得其門者或寡矣、夫子之云、不亦宜乎。
        CHAP. XXIII. 1. Shu-sun Wu-shu observed to the great 
officers in the court, saying, 'Tsze-kung is superior to Chung-ni.'
        2. Tsze-fu Ching-po reported the observation to Tsze-
kung, who said, 'Let me use the comparison of a house and its 
encompassing wall. My wall only reaches to the shoulders. One 
may peep over it, and see whatever is valuable in the 
apartments.
        3. 'The wall of my Master is several fathoms high. If one 
do not find the door and enter by it, he cannot see the ancestral 
temple with its beauties, nor all the officers in their rich array.
        4. 'But I may assume that they are few who find the door. 
Was not the observation of the chief only what might have 
been expected?'

【廿四章】叔孫武叔毀仲尼。子貢曰、無以為也、仲尼不可毀也、他人之賢

於日月乎、多見其不知量也。

子貢曰、君子一言以為知、一言以為不知、言不可不慎也。【三節】夫子之
        CHAP. XXIV. Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly of 
Chung-ni, Tsze-kung said, 'It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni 
cannot be reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are 
hillocks and mounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is 
the sun or moon, which it is not possible to step over. Although 
a man may wish to cut himself off from the sage, what harm 
can he do to the sun or moon? He only shows that he does not 
know his own capacity.
        CHAP. XXV. 1. Ch'an Tsze-ch'in, addressing Tsze-kung, 
said, 'You are too modest. How can Chung-ni be said to be 
superior to you?'
        2. Tsze-kung said to him, 'For one word a man is often 
deemed to be wise, and for one word he is often deemed to be 
foolish. We ought to be careful indeed in what we say.
        3. 'Our Master cannot be attained to, just in the same way 
as the heavens cannot be gone up to by the steps of a stair.

不可及也、猶天之不可階而升也。【四節】夫子之得邦家者、所謂立之斯立、
道之期行、綏之期來、動之斯和、其生也榮、其死也哀、如之何其可及也。
        4. 'Were our Master in the position of the ruler of a State 
or the chief of a Family, we should find verified the description 
which has been given of a sage's rule:-- he would plant the 
people, and forthwith they would be established; he would lead 
them on, and forthwith they would follow him; he would make 
them happy, and forthwith multitudes would resort to his 
dominions; he would stimulate them, and forthwith they would 
be harmonious. While he lived, he would be glorious. When he 
died, he would be bitterly lamented. How is it possible for him 
to be attained to?'

        CHAP. I. 1. Yao said, 'Oh! you, Shun, the Heaven-
determined order of succession now rests in your person. 
Sincerely hold fast the due Mean. If there shall be distress and 
want within the four seas, the Heavenly revenue will come to a 
perpetual end.'
        2. Shun also used the same language in giving charge to 
Yu.
        3. T'ang said, 'I the child Li, presume to use a dark-
coloured victim, and presume to announce to Thee, O most 
great and sovereign God, that the sinner I dare not pardon, and 
thy ministers, O God, I do not keep in obscurity. The 
examination of them is by thy mind, O God. If, in my person, I 
commit offences, they are not to be attributed to you, the 
people of the myriad regions. If you in the myriad regions 
commit offences, these offences must rest on my person.'

        4. Chau conferred great gifts, and the good were enriched.
        5. 'Although he has his near relatives, they are not equal 
to my virtuous men. The people are throwing blame upon me, 
the One man.'
        6. He carefully attended to the weights and measures, 
examined the body of the laws, restored the discarded officers, 
and the good government of the kingdom took its course.
        7. He revived States that had been extinguished, restored 
families whose line of succession had been broken, and called 
to office those who had retired into obscurity, so that 
throughout the kingdom the hearts of the people turned 
towards him.
        8. What he attached chief importance to, were the food of 
the people, the duties of mourning, and sacrifices.
        9. By his generosity, he won all. By his sincerity, he made 
the people repose trust in him. By his earnest activity, his 
achievements were great. By his justice, all were delighted.

【第二章】【一節】子張問於孔子曰、何如、斯可以從政矣。子曰、尊五美、
屏四惡、斯可以從政矣。子張曰、何謂五美。子曰、君子惠、而不費、勞、
而不怨、欲、而不貪、泰、而不驕、威、而不猛。【二節】子張曰、何謂惠
而不費。子曰、因民之所利而利之、
        CHAP. II. 1. Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, 'In what 
way should a person in authority act in order that he may 
conduct government properly?' The Master replied, 'Let him 
honour the five excellent, and banish away the four bad, 
things;-- then may he conduct government properly.' Tsze-
chang said, 'What are meant by the five excellent things?' The 
Master said, 'When the person in authority is beneficent 
without great expenditure; when he lays tasks on the people 
without their repining; when he pursues what he desires 
without being covetous; when he maintains a dignified ease 
without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.'
        2. Tsze-chang said, 'What is meant by being beneficent 
without great expenditure?' The Master replied, 'When the 
person in authority makes more beneficial to the people the 
things from which

斯不亦惠而不費乎、擇可勞而勞之、又誰怨、欲仁而得仁、又焉貪、君子無
眾寡、無小大、無敢慢、斯不亦泰而不驕乎、君子正其衣冠、尊其瞻視、儼
然人望而畏之、斯不亦威而不猛乎。【三節】子張曰、何謂四惡。子曰、不
教而殺、謂之虐、不戒視成、謂之暴、慢令致期、謂之賊、猶
they naturally derive benefit;-- is not this being beneficent 
without great expenditure? When he chooses the labours which 
are proper, and makes them labour on them, who will repine? 
When his desires are set on benevolent government, and he 
secures it, who will accuse him of covetousness? Whether he 
has to do with many people or few, or with things great or 
small, he does not dare to indicate any disrespect;-- is not this 
to maintain a dignified ease without any pride? He adjusts his 
clothes and cap, and throws a dignity into his looks, so that, 
thus dignified, he is looked at with awe;-- is not this to be 
majestic without being fierce?'
        3. Tsze-chang then asked, 'What are meant by the four 
bad things?' The Master said, 'To put the people to death 
without having instructed them;-- this is called cruelty. To 
require from them, suddenly, the full tale of work, without 
having given them warning;-- this is called oppression. To issue 
orders as if without urgency, at first, and, when the time 
comes, to insist on them with severity;-- this is called injury. 
And, generally, in the giving pay

or rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-- this is called 
acting the part of a mere official.'
        CHAP III. 1. The Master said, 'Without recognising the 
ordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man.
        2. 'Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it 
is impossible for the character to be established.
        3. 'Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible to 
know men.'
